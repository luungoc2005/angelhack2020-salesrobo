[{"text":"\n  This game is horrible, Nintendo decided to add hours to it by slowing down the game text instead of adding content. The battle system is spinning a puzzle wheel to line up enemies and well not much else. As someone who has loved most of the mario rpg/paper mario series this game makes me want to give up on it. FU Nintendo for releasing this trash.\n","id":"4fdb4950-8927-4f55-a374-59840fd9a07f"},{"text":"\n  Don't recommend for any Mario or RPG fans. I would've liked the game because of its writing, story and overworld, but the game is bogged down by a complete erasure of what made Paper Mario good, adding in this poorly done, watered down battle system with no flair, no strategy and no stakes. No good progression system since leveling was taken out, because the developers think children can't handle basic RPGs despite most adults growing up with the genre since they were nearly toddlers. If I could return the game straight to Nintendo for it's poor quality, I would. All style, no substance, barely worth 1/4th of its price, and if the developer of this game doesn't understand what makes either Paper Mario or and RPG good, he should probably be replaced.\n","id":"5753f807-a8e3-4e32-8834-87141fa73b8d"},{"text":"\n  During a time when my world doesn't make sense, I was looking forward to a great story in a lovely little world that does. This game is not it.  I loved Thousand Year Door, liked Super Paper Mario Wii, Color Splash was different but pleasant, but this game...I am so disappointed.  It's like they threw everything at it and nothing all at once.  It's just so unsatisfying and pointless that it makes you question why you even wasted the time. And the new fight format!?...take that same feeling when you had to do those timed multiplication worksheets in grade school and that's what you have.I have only played through the first ribbon color section, and I wanted to like it so very much, but I just don't know if I can bring myself to trudge through more.\n","id":"cc48145c-b72d-4747-bff1-f06110660ee4"},{"text":"\n  I haven't played the first Paper Mario game but I loved TTYD and Super Paper Mario but since then the Paper Mario games lost their charm.

Nintendo can be proud that they brought the series back from the brink of ruin.\n","id":"7ed31f78-ad43-4c8f-a0c7-dffc3e4b4a21"},{"text":"\n  This game is so much fun.

Highly recommended.\n","id":"e8e66cc1-73e5-403e-9efc-0ffc5d6ef3c8"},{"text":"\n  I was hesitant to purchase an item with no reviews, but am very happy I took a chance on this origami book!  This is a large book, with large, colorful, paper for folding (Product Dimensions: 11.5 x 0.7 x 10.9 inches).  There are three colorful printed pages plus three black and white design pages to be colored per origami design.  Pages are perforated for easy removal.  The paper is sturdy, but folds easily, and makes nice creases and points.  The instructions are clear and fairly easy to follow, but if you are unsure how to do a step, simply scan the QR code on the first instruction page of a project, and watch a quick video example of the project step by step.  I used the camera setting on my iPhone, which immediately pulled up the webpage for the project.  When unsure what to do, this was an immediate and clear help. I like that there are fold lines lightly printed on the papers to assist beginners.  Be sure to read the introduction, which has valuable information, before you begin your first project.  There are enough pages in this book (total of 6 per project) that several kids can make the same project at the same time, or one child can make the same project several times.  My 7yr old granddaughter is thrilled with this book and can read most of the instructions and make the projects with help.  As a teacher, I think the projects in this book would hold the interest of ages 6-10 or higher.  I highly recommend this book for young kids interested in making simple origami projects and learning some basic procedures.\n","id":"cc625df6-a735-4bfa-abb4-5cb4a0b2430d"},{"text":"\n  I bought this to entertain my kids in lockdown, and instead they are coming up to me for help during meetings. Complete fail.The drawings are pointlessly confusing and misleading. They do not show actual representation of the pages, so you can't tell which side of the paper you are supposed to be folding nor in what direction. I just finished the cicada for my kid, who couldn't even begin to understand- one side is plain orange and one side has a bug print. What was being displayed as the orange side of the paper was actually representing the other side with designs on it, so as we folded, none of the prints were matching up. So frustrating.\n","id":"baf50e5e-4fdf-46b0-b625-7f8794866d33"},{"text":"\n  Really great. It’s really big, which makes it easier for little fingers. The colors and designs are really pretty. I love that there are several copies of each project so each of my girls can do one. The difficulty is clearly noted, from one to three, and the instructions are reasonably clear with really well done videos easily accessed by QR code. Also I love that a few of them come with black and white outlines so they can color them themselves. Well done and worth the price.\n","id":"d0677cbd-3ea3-4cbd-b5d8-b1663a2fa5e1"},{"text":"\n  My kid loved it!There are 2-3 colored sheets of each model in the book, which is really great for folding along.

I've bought two packs of it now, and in both packs the colored papers are not distributed evenly. In the first pack I only had three sheets of that first pink color (far left, on the front cover). And in the second pack I had maybe five pink sheets. I would just like the same number of sheets of each color. That doesn't seem like too much to ask...\n","id":"d977f5ca-1a61-42cb-a823-97d8b6798ff0"},{"text":"\n  I have bought two packs for the purpose of modular origam. Be warned, with 12 duo varieties (solid/solid) there is no better option on Amazon for this price. However, the colors for each variety may be lighter or darker from pack to pack. First pack to second pack, about 4-6 of the varieties have noticeable differences in shade.Additionally, when folding you may experience the color flaking off very slightly in places, revealing the white paper underneath. I'm making things that require thirty papers, so the white bits, which didn't always happen, but if I did it was not really noticeable. Also, the paper is perfectly square, just not 6\" exactly, measures larger by about half a cm.It's always confusing when origami paper reviewers say the paper is too thin...my impression is that it's supposed to be! So yes, it is very thin. It will not break if you are folding mindfully. In fact the paper is sturdy. A hangnail started bleeding onto my papers and I was able to dab off the blood by..brace urself...licking it off. When my spit dried, it was like nothing had ever happened to the paper: good as new. Really, less than $10 for 200 mostly flawless papers is great and I am satisfied.\n","id":"46c0f7d8-7454-42ee-b55c-c9881e2008c3"},{"text":"\n  With many patterned papers, I needed solid colors to coordinate in some models. Other packs I've gotten just didn't pop the way I wanted. FINALLY found these and they are perfect! The colors are not neon, but are much brighter than others I've gotten. Each sheet has different solid colors on the 2 sides (bright blue/red, ark blue/red, purple/yellow, purple/green +++). The paper is easy to work with, crisp folds that hold well. I'll buy these again.

There are so many things wrong with this product!  I bought this based on the good reviews & am highly disappointed.  I included pictures to prove that this is an honest & unbiased review.  The pictures show that what I am describing is accurate.1) As others have stated, there are only 12 patterns.  Description is very misleading.  It sounds like there will be 365 patterns, one new for each day of the year.  Nope, just paper for each day. (Hopefully, I didn’t count the paper quantity though.)2) Worst paper I have ever used for origami!  Paper is thin, horrible to fold, creases show the white paper under the printing, pattern print color quality is awful (paper that is “supposed” to be the same color/design can have a slight but noticeable difference-but not enough to say it is meant to be that way, paper design selection seems a little off- two of some things and 16 or 20 of another (I know it doesn’t state how many of each you will receive but this really seems like I was given the scraps/left overs that couldn’t be used for other products), & worst of all, it is NOT even cut square!!!  ALL three sizes & every design are cut crooked!!!  It’s not even because they were from a single defective batch because they are ALL off on DIFFERENT sides, sometimes one side, others have two sides cut crooked, & some have all four sides cut wrong.  I am folding 1,000 cranes & I am so disappointed in the cranes I have made from this paper.  I have used several different patterns & sizes to see if any of them work so I doubt I’m going to be able to return it.  I am probably going to throw it in the garbage & just lose the money I spent on it.  Either the product has changed, I received a really strange bad batch, or reviews are not all being posted fairly.\n","id":"f0269129-0bc7-48ec-9d38-5edcb3cb575b"},{"text":"\n  The folds are easy but I'm a little disappointed. When it said \" Includes 365 sheets for a year of fun\" i thought on 365 designs too. Boy was I wrong.

Immediately after I opened it up I took a look through all the diagrams and decided that it was worth the wait! The diagrams are gorgeous and detailed and in color, which is helpful since the units can be quite complex, and it really highlights how the unit should look at each step.I've been working my way through from the front of the book and starting to tackle the wire frames in the second half of the book. The weaving instructions are detailed and explain and show you how the symmetry of the models work, so you get to fully understand how they fit together, versus blindly following instructions. (This is something I have found to be lacking in the construction of the first wire frame I ever folded, Tom Hull's Five Intersecting Tetrahedra, so I was pleased to find such instruction in this book.)If you purchase this (an action I heartily recommend) you should start clearing some room to display your models! They will take some time, but the end results are worth it.\n","id":"02c1efad-5b32-4772-8f20-cc7184b5eb70"},{"text":"\n  Some very difficult models! I have experience with modular origami models. These ones were a new challenge for me in that for the second half of the book it requires very specific rectangular cuts of paper. The majority of the difficulty is not is folding the units but in the weaving of them to construct the model. Expect to have to look at the reference images intensely to figure out exactly where to weave what part. I do wish it came with more reference images, showing exact angles and weaving directions but the ones present are the minimum required to show you exactly what to do. This is an excellent book showing how to model some of the most fascinating interlocked models in all of origami.

These are modular units that lock together and form balls or polyhedra at a rate of 3-5 units per face, depending. Some are definitely time consuming to fold but, overall it's great. The entire back half of the book is devoted to increasingly complex constructed, interwoven models. These push almost immediately into a hundred units or more, with complicated weaving schemes. I've made a few things out of the first half of the book and not a single thing from the back.

Having read the dozens of previous reviews about the top part splitting, I was prepared for the worst. When I opened the box and took out the cart, I noticed that although the wood had not yet split, it was going to. I could see where the pieces of wood were glued together and the glue was already dry and chalky and falling out of the seam. It's only a matter of time before it splits. BUT.....with that being said, I also know (being the daughter of a hobbyist woodworker) that it's a simple fix that will take less time and effort than repacking and shipping it back to Amazon and waiting for another cart that will most likely have the same issue. One must weigh the principle of being able to have a perfect product right out of the box, with practicality and common sense....hey, it's cheap. You get what you pay for. And fixing it is cheap and easier than shipping it back. I'm sure you could go to youtube and find a dozen or so tutorials on how to glue wood together using a couple of clamps and some Elmer's wood glue. So, if you want a rolling kitchen cart that's top quality and doesn't have a top that'll split after a month or two, you'll need to spend a few hundred dollars and get something that's not mass produced in China. Or just spend a few bucks re-glueing this one.For the price, I'm pretty happy. And other than the top splitting issue, this cart is pretty sturdy and has some good weight to it. I will be using it for many different things, including some craft shows. I'll be removing the towel bar on the side (another easy thing to do) and putting a skirt around the whole thing. It's ideal for this sort of situation since it folds up and even has a great carrying case (that you must purchase separately...which I did.)I'll update my review once the top has fully split and I repair it. I'll try to remember to post photos with instructions so you can repair yours easily, too.\n","id":"8c2d2714-05ba-4939-8730-030bbde8936d"},{"text":"\n  I love how easily Origami products go together.

My coffee cart is entirely mobile, so for the past 2 months, I set it up at local businesses, break it down before the weekend, and put it in the trunk of my Prius...every single week. For the price, it's a decent little cart, but I couldn't begin to guess how long it's going to last.It did crack on the wood surface like many others have mentioned...and within only a month of use. I also purchased the canvas zip up bag to transport it to and from my car, which has probably extended the life of it, but overall, the cart is pretty wobbly and feels like it has loose screws, even though I don't think there's any screws to actually tighten. It's been like this since day 1, so I know it's not from moving it around constantly.Overall, my guests love the look of it (I have it paired up with wooden crates,) and are always very amused at my idea, even though it took next to nothing to get it started. For home use, I'd highly recommend.

Myself and my husband also were left scratching our heads on a few. My son has been doing star wars origami and more for a couple of years now so we figured we would try this one for our little muggle.  He LOVES HARRY POTTER LOVES ORAGAMI, but won't use this book. He tried for about two days and stopped. He was so excited when he opened it inn his birthday....but the fun quickly fizzled away.First, some of these projects are kiragami, which involves cutting. Also may need tape and glue, etc..what kind of origami is this? It involves parent help for sure and messy. Supplies everywhere! Origami is supposed to be good, clean fun lol.Next, the projects are already difficult for younger children, but can be done after a bit of practice, BUT you have to use the paper they included to make folding easier to understand and to get the real look. Without it, the hat just looks like a pointy turd, etc. They just don't look correct without the fancy paper...which the book only comes with one piece per project. Each piece is difficult to get out of the book without ripping it all up though. Fold it wrong the first time, your fancy paper is unusable and the project looks less HARRY POTTER. Parents need to help...Not an alone play time type fun.Ours came release day, all smashed up and ruined, had to send back for replacement.All in all, this book had pretty color photos, cool looking, but not practical at ALL, especially for younger kids...more like Middle school grade and up.

The origami designs are clever, and they are thoughtfully arranged so that they start with simpler designs and concepts and then progress into more complicated projects. The paper is beautifully designed and printed (often on both sides) to greatly add to the overall effect of the finished items.My one quibble (aside from the fact that there is only enough of the specially designed paper to make one of each design, at least with the more complex ones like Hogwarts Castle) is that you have to CUT THE PAPER OUT OF THE BACK OF THE BOOK. Take a pair of scissors to a beautiful book like this? Never. Besides, do you throw the book away afterwards, or keep it in its lopsided state in case you want to make any of the designs again with other paper? It would have been better to have a packet of paper slipped into a pocket attached to the back cover.I will be making many of these with my own paper, and I'll be honest, I may make color copies of some of the paper designs so I can enjoy them as intended.

I was so excited to get lots of pieces of paper and learn to fold them like owls, dragons, broomsticks, wands, even witches and wizards!But this book doesn't contain traditional origami paper and instructions; it has templates with full color illustrations. So you can basically just make each object one time (with the book...if you have mad art skills, you could duplicate the illustrations on other pieces of paper and make the objects over and over). This is more for a young child. I'd say 6-9, who doesn't know or care what Origami is, just wants to fold the paper and make Potter things. :(\n","id":"7bbe2349-62c0-4b30-a4e2-dd88311a4eb0"},{"text":"\n  My 10-year-old loves origami and is pretty good at it, and this book is pretty advanced for him.

I was unaware of the footwork genre before hearing about Jlin.  Quite interesting.While I like much of the music, it feels like it could use some editing.  Pretty much every piece strikes me as to long.  (I find this to be true of 90% of the electronic music I listen to.  Even music created for the purpose of dancing can have some thematic movement.)It's quite possible that there are subtleties I am missing because I am unfamiliar with the genre.When I first listened to reggae, for example, I swore every song was the same song, and it was only after some exposure that I began to pick up on assorted nuances.Perhaps that's the case here.  But, even after repeated listens, I'm still stuck with the feeling that the musical ideas are insufficiently developed.I have in mind to create my own private version of the album by editing tracks down to about 2/3 their length.The music is quite striking in more constrained segments\n","id":"354dab80-4025-42bd-9ebc-39b893b8e076"},{"text":"\n  \"Black Origami\" takes from a bottomless well of interesting sounds: grunts, chants, video game noises, creepy telephone calls, and marching band drums.

The teacher, the friend, the \"perverted wizard\" and the Origami monster.  (The monster was a 3 yr old girl, who behaved well for a three year old. It's just that she was far too young for this DVD. The reason I call her \"Origami monster\" will be evident soon and is purely for dramatic effect)The DVD starts with the teacher Kayo, teaching how to make a crane, while the 3 year old Origami monster keeps disturbing her. Her greatest joy is to try to unfold, destroy and open/rip any Origami model she can lay her hands on. The teacher is completely out of control and even answers the cell phone in the middle of teaching, completely on camera. Not to mention, speaking in Japanese during the teaching and phone call. Her friend, Mayumi, visits her and demonstrates how to make a not so basic Sonobe type module and eventually makes the 12 piece pointed ball star. What beginners DVD begins with cranes and Sonobe modulars modules?? To add insult to injury, the \"perverted wizard,\" Sam makes a brief appearance where he sits next to friend and kisses her and is all very touchy and obvious in his affection for his teacher wife's friend. We all had flashes of some reality TV while watching this.Part two of the DVD is a more formal teaching of origami. I use the word teaching quiet liberally in this review. The formal teaching is also short lived as after teaching 4 models ; crane, waterbomb, purse and pigeon, the three year old monster resurrects and starts her demolition.To top it all, the teacher even does some cloth/scarf folding and actually makes a bra.This DVD can be summed up in the teachers own words (pronounced with her accent),  \"This is origami 'sheet'\".Shrikant\n","id":"27a9f026-1cc0-4d76-9e37-08511cffbdeb"},{"text":"\n  The whole program is a fiasco from the begining.

This record features works by four composers who have each contributed to the distinctive musical community in New York over the last few decades. Each composer worked closely with James Ilgenfritz to write music that was a hybrid of their own creative vision and James’s unusual approach to the bass.As one music mind stated, ‘From hypnotic drone works involving Just Intonation and use of multiple bows to astounding feats of technical virtuosity, this collection of works brings hyper- complexity, improvisation, and lyrical beauty together into a deeply personal tour-de-force of musical invention.’The works n this recording are ‘Rolling Sevens and Dreaming Elevens’ by Annie Gosfield - a piece based on re-arranging James’s unusual vocabulary of extended techniques into a virtuosic hyper-industrial treatise on texture and rhythm, ‘Four Moons of Pluto’ by Miya Masaoka -a delicate, drone-based work built on sustained harmonics and microtonal tunings, ‘Xigliox’ by JG Thirlwell - a work that constantly careens from lyricism to ferocity, from precision to frenetic abandon and ’Aletheia’ by Elliott Sharp - a work that employs unusual bows and objects, from using multiple bows at once to using springs and ball chains to get bizarre, other-worldly textures from the bass.James Ilgenfritz is a master of his instrument and a virtuoso in bringing new waves of sound to the world. He also is active as a bandleader, sideman and composer. Grady Harp, March 17\n","id":"8263edac-ffe9-4940-bda8-2b0de1cda7ad"},{"text":"\n  Wow!

But I find that I'm quickly bored with the simple designs they provide.This book is the perfect next step in your journey.  Be aware that the models are essentially sequential.  Meaning that each model builds on the techniques of the one before it. You may not, for example,  want to build another Nun model but you should try it just to understand the techniques involved.  The models quite quickly move into the upper intermediate to advanced levels.  But take your time and work through them.  I even suggest making key models multiple times to really understand the concepts behind them.I particularly like the shark model since it shows new ways to manipulate the classic bird base.  I also really like the kangaroo which is vastly more realistically proportioned the typical kangaroo model you see in other books.  Also, it has 2 legs, 2 arms, a head and a tail.  That's 6 appendages and yet it's made from a triangle.  Think about that.  6 appendages made from a shape with only 3 corners.By the time you get to the intermediate and advanced models you should expect to be quite challenged.

Here's why so many dogs seem to not only love this toy but - in spite of having major destructive chewing capabilities - tend not to destroy it right away:  They think it's alive.  I'm not kidding.  Something about the texture and shape of the pig's body combined with the oinking noise it emits (from very small squeeze 'oinks' to big squeeze 'OINKS!!').  Our three year old girl with jaw pressure exceeding 200 lbs.  treats this toy as if it were a puppy that needed her nurturing care.  These pig toys tend to last longer than most others for that reason.Although, given constant access, sooner or later the toy will be destroyed.  Our dog trainer taught us that (in the case of large dogs like ours who love to chew and can destroy just about any toy) not to let our dog have ANY toy for more than a few minutes at a time.  As a result, we will let her play with the piggie for a few minutes and then take it away from her and put it somewhere safe.  We have a couple of piggies aka. \"Oinky the Pig\" that have now lasted over two months.Now, on to the EZPZ noisemaker repair/restoration:  The thing is that the noisemaker inside the toy is about five inches long and has a somewhat round body.  The business end of the noisemaker comes from the factory plugged into a sleeve in the mouth of the pig toy with only the elasticity of the latex sleeve holding it in place.  Once your/our dog starts playing vigorously with the toy it's only a matter of time before the noisemaker becomes dislodged from the sleeve and the pig becomes mute.  Eventually, given enough time and really aggressive biting - any strong jawed dog has the capacity to destroy the noisemaker and/or piggie entirely - at which time - repair/restoration is impossible.If your piggie is relatively new and has suddenly gone silent, chances are good that it's because the noisemaker has become dislodged from the toy's 'mouth'.  There's a short, hard, plastic tube at the end of the noisemaker that is designed to fit perfectly into an inverted latex sleeve (the piggie's 'mouth').In order to restore/repair - grasp the pig's body firmly in one hand and with the other hand squeeze the body until you can feel the noisemaker inside.  It may take a bit of braille fumbling before you can visualize the shape of the noisemaker.  But once you do?  Grab hold of the noismaker through the latex body and begin manipulating, pushing, the business end of it (the short, hard, plastic tube) back towards the inverted sleeve in the pig's 'mouth'.  Work the pig's body in small accordion like moves until you can manipulate the plastic tube back into the latex 'mouth' sleeve.  Then press forward until you can shove the tube all the way back into the sleeve.  This normally takes less than a minute to accomplish. You'll know you've succeeded by squeezing the pig's body and having it happily oinking at you (and your dog) once again.Keep in mind that this repair will likely be temporary because - in due time, with enough doggie boops and bites the noisemaker will once again become dislodged.  When that happens? Rinse and Repeat.Our Rottie has had several \"Oinky the Pig\" toys since she was a puppy.  She will and has destroyed several of them after extended play over the past three years.  This has been the inevitable fate due to her size and bite strength.  However, in the short run, I have successfully repaired/restored the noisemaker for these toys and put them back into play dozens and dozens of times.My dog's show of great affection and appreciation when she hears \"Oinky the Pig\" still has its voice has been all the reward I needed to keep it up.  Hope this helps.\n","id":"5c60c6c5-ed3f-4af4-ac9f-c57a1b17ac01"},{"text":"\n  I use to buy these at Walmart for a dollar per one toy pig.

If you have a large or rough dog, eventually it will be destroyed, but they have SO much fun with it in the meantime.  The noisemaker will probably fail first, then eventually it may tear a little.

Well, it is still one of their favorites.  My almost year-old Lab has slowly ripped a bit more from the body, so I trim as needed to remove tears and leave a smooth edge so it's harder to tear.  I bought another for Xmas - the oinker is dead and there are a couple of small holes, but the oinker and fiberfill are still in it.  The other body is still going strong too (one of her original puppy toys).\n","id":"972de190-a4e4-4ad9-afce-80b8ba1d9461"},{"text":"\n  I got these for my three dogs and they all loved them, but our puppy kept stealing them from the other two because he loves them so much!

She systematically chews out the squeaker, then chews off the legs, ears, nose until we finally have to put the poor pig out of its misery. The pet store ones I buy were running us $11 apiece and she would have the squeaker out within 30 min. She's a French Bulldog - she is single-minded and obsessive. I was limiting her to 10 min with her piglet at a time and she was very unhappy about that.These were cheaper - that's the only reason I bought them. But I wasn't prepared for the quality difference! She chewed and sucked (yes, she sucks things - see video) on this pig for almost 2 hours and the thing survived unscathed. The feet are teeny so she has a hard time getting her chewing teeth on them, yet she can pick him up and carry him around using her front teeth. The squeaker is well-protected by the sturdy snout, and the rubber material is thicker than the other pigs I was getting.All in all a win/win. Diva dog is happy and so is my wallet.\n","id":"73fb3850-38b9-4ed9-b52f-4fde79109f3c"},{"text":"\n  I ordered the Square cover recently because the original cover disintegrated into long tears and strips  while being used in my garage.

The guy uses a piece of regular copy paper not too precisely cut into a square.  The first thing he's supposed to be telling you is how to make a (rectangular) piece of paper square.  But he doesn't really show how you do it, he shows that he did it and shows the piece he cut off.  How about just demonstrating how it's done?  It's not that hard to do.  I also think they could have used actual origami paper, preferably with a color on one side because that makes it easier for a beginner to see what to do.  Like the first reviewer, I did not (could not) watch the entire video.  He described the steps in the projects as \"Fold this, like this, then fold it this way\".  He did not actually describe what he was doing at all.  And at times as he was basically telling you to watch what he was doing, because he surely wasn't going to tell you what he was doing, he blocked your view of the paper with his hand.  Yes, incredibly he tried to demonstrate what to do but did not allow the audience to see it.  He really seemed confused and unfamiliar with what he was trying to do.  Another strange thing about this video is that demonstrator began the instructions for several items by starting out with a paper that already had several folds in it.  No clue how he got it that way.  And finally I found it quite annoying that there was no depiction of what the completed object would look like.  One item was a \"spinner\".  I still don't have any idea what kind of spinner it was because that would have required looking at his demonstration and I just couldn't bear any more.  There are good Origami DVDs for beginners.  This isn't one of them.  \"Origami Fun for Kids, Too!\" is a much, much better piece of work and I would recommend that you look at that one instead of this one.\n","id":"d2aebbb3-cb74-4d0d-8f0b-f00772d47d7a"},{"text":"\n  At the end of the day--you start with 6 sheets of paper and end with 6 origami sculptures.

That is what matters.This video shows you how to create new and different art. Furthermore, I would say... Get the video... follow the instructions and [practice] making these paper art pieces.

The album manages to deal with topics of depression (Fly Away To Hell) and managing people's perceptions (You Don't Know What You're Asking) all while being extremely accessible. This an extremely well crafted record that sounds like a band is performing rather than what you'd imagine from a singer songwriter. He is the former lead singer of The Lonely Forest which might explain his sounding \"at ease\" in a band. To be clear, this album doesn't sound like The Lonely Forest re-imagined. Great for fans of emo/indie/power-pop. It's difficult to pin down one influence. I think fans of 90s Weezer, Sunny Day Real Estate (Diary era), and more melodic Pixies songs (Gigantic, Here Comes Your Man, etc.) will enjoy this record.\n","id":"3b3953b3-ef6f-4fdf-b89a-41922401fa07"},{"text":"\n  You remember summers ago when the new millennium was just a few years old and you would crank Weezer's Blue Album, or early Switchfoot, or MxPx and just drive?

Until it's not, and suddenly you've walked from the heights of \"Let Me Let You Use My Power\" (the track I've played to death) through the shimmery bop that is \"Steal From Myself (It's All About Me!)\" (which feels a little like Ezra Koenig wrote a song with The Wonders in the best possible way) to the depths of the lonely, and painfully beautiful introspection of \"If All Is Nothing\" and \"Fly Away To Hell\". These two songs signal the sonic arrival of the catacomb Van Deusen cleverly walked us toward in lyric, even as the music of the first tracks spoke something more joyful. The whole album is an expert journey of the soul, and though it walks back out of the valley, it stops shy of a happy ending - perhaps the most genius move of the whole piece.

Also common cards (as oppose to stickers) are purchasable via in-game coins/currency. Coins are very abundant if you participate in the Ro-Sham-Bo tournaments so you don't have to worry about not having enough cards. There is resource management involved though as you can only hold a certain amount of cards in your inventory until upgraded thus a recommend re-stalking on cards after each level. Also paint is a factor now as painting cards helps deal more damage and certain cards uses specific color of paint.Battle interface is a bit troublesome at first as there's a lot of steps involved to initiate an attack. But after a while, you grow used to it as in later levels you soon realize you have to manage your resources well in order to progress smoothly through a level or defeat a boss.To initiate an attack you have to:1. Scroll/swipe through a list of cards2. Click Card Ready3. Paint the card4. Click Paint Ready5. Flick up the cards6. Look up at TV screen to initiate attackSome steps can be improved for faster battling, but after a while you get used to it.Step 1 could be simplified to have cards grouped in columns depending on type. If you take too long deciding or finding a card, an enemy can steal a random card from youStep 2 and especially 4 is unnecessaryStep 3. Thought it was useless at first, but you dont' have to paint the card all the way if you can think you can defeat the enemy with less paint, thus saving your resourcesStep 5 and 6. Aside from the choosing and painting cards this could be done on the main screen, making for a great off-TV game play instead of having to use both TV and gamepad. But overall, the gameplay doesn't drag the game down as you'll get used to it after a while as it becomes second nature.Careful timing still present like in past titles as you have to hit a button at the right time to do additional attacks or block the enemy attack for half damage takenLove the visual of this game, very good presentation with the character's animations and use of paper and paint aestheticScript is well done also, a lot of laugh-out-load (LOL) moments (Sample screenshots to follow). The plot is very generic, but the dialogue among characters us very fun, natural  and creative. A huge highlight in my enjoyment of the game.Overall you get over two dozen hours playing the main campaign with tons of collecting to do after.

You could tell that the writers for this game kind of did whatever they wanted to. This game was snarky and completely over the top with it's sense of humor but that's what made the entire game fun.The only con I have to this game was the battle system. It was very cumbersome and required entirely too much effort for something I felt should have been playtested and streamlined a lot better than it was.In order to execute 1 attack round on enemies you had to...  - Scroll through your list of 100 cards and find the ones you want (you can only use the Wii U gamepad touchscreen)  - Swipe them up into one of your available attack slots  - Tap to confirm those are the cards you want  - color in each card if it isn't already  - Tap to confirm you are done coloring  - Swipe up to confirm you are ready to attack  - Finally, execute your attack movesIn closing, this game is fun and funny at times, and if it weren't for the terrible battle system which made you want to sneak around and run from enemies more than fighting them, this would totally be a 5 star game.\n","id":"89220346-0146-446b-bf39-4762140f7f5e"},{"text":"\n  Conflicted.

I practiced with my son (~4.5 yrs) the basic folds first...he of course could follow only the most basic folds and up to some point....then we folded dinosaurs going by instruction, mostly I folded them and it was a lot of fun. It was still difficult for me to shape the small feet, and some of the heads (T-rex, with opened mouth) I could not do. But being a beginner (pretty much never done much origami), I could make fair number of designs in this book. Also, it was fun to watch my son imitate the folds (of course doing it in his own way) and name them \"kite fold\", \"squash fold\" etc., then fold the paper by his own imagination and then explain to me that it is pterodactyl. He also invented his own technique which he still called \"origami\" in which he cuts out dinosaur body parts from recycled paper and sticks them together with stickers (or skotch tape) forming a dinosaur (kind of crafts, but for us this evolved from trying to do real origami). This technique he could use independently to create various dinosaurs without my help.

When I received, it looks like \"golden oak.\"  It is okay but I would have preferred it in darker color.  Nonetheless, it looks pretty.For the length I need to set them as, I had to use 5 of the 6 screws for each one.  Note that it comes with 6 screws.  For shorter length set up, you only need 4 screws.I use these gates when I have to work (4 days a week). I have 2 Shih Tzus and one of them is aging, 13 years old now.

Yes, the sides fold on the sides but the length that I have them in is not something that would fit in the closet.  To shorten the gates to its shortest length, I have to unscrew 5 screws and screw it back to the shortest length, which is a major inconvenience for me and I am afraid, it will wear out the screw if I do that once a week.

I think with any gate that doesn't latch, if you have large dogs, you should expect that if your dogs try and move the gate, they will. That being said, I have a chihuahua and a pit/lab mix and neither one of them try and move it. The gate has little rubber pegs on the bottom that grip the hardwood floors pretty well - well enough that my 3 year old had a hard time sliding the gate around to get through the door way. We had to put felt pads under the outer pegs so my daughter could get in and out (see picture I posted), but the dogs still don't try and move the gate. Also, the picture looks like the felt pads would come off easily, but the gate is heavy enough that it doesn't lift off the ground often enough for that to be a problem. The weight of the gate helps to keep those little suckers in place.When I first pulled the pieces out of the box I could tell right away, this is a good gate. The wood is solid and the the black metal bars throughout the gate have been nicely painted. You can compare the metal wire gate part to the metal wire on an old fashioned floor fan or a really nice hamster cage. The materials are definitely not flimsy at  all. The gate is very easy to adjust, although oddly enough, this part of the gate is probably it's only downfall. I don't like it how you can only adjust it by unscrewing 5 large screws, adjusting it, and then screwing the screws back in again. Like I said though, the screws are large, which makes the process pretty easy to deal with and accept. All in all, I think the gate is very good quality, it does what it's supposed to, and it's beautiful. It has just enough elegance that it really could be used in any house hold and look right.

It looks good, the workmanship is better than I expected (nice stitching around the edges), fits nicely, the cover works as it should to wake or sleep the device and, most importantly, works very nicely as a sturdy stand on a table so I can read without holding the Kindle in my hand. The angle is just right (at least for me) and feels quite secure so that it won't knock over easily - especially on an aircraft tray table.I air-traveled a few times last year with the Kindle Oasis and really missed the origami case that came with the Voyager so I'm very glad that someone decided to address this omission that Amazon made with the Oasis. One thing I want to point out is that it's a bit on the heavy side and adds a noticeable amount of heft when compared to the Amazon leather case. I think that has to do with the cover which also needs to be a sturdy stand. If I want to read the Kindle in my hand, I'll definitely take it out of the case.Overall, I'm quite happy with this. It's a very good value, looks handsome, protects the Kindle very well and does everything it is supposed to do.

He broke out of every swaddle we tried. So far this one hugs him snuggly, but still allows him to move which he seems to enjoy. The material does seem to stretch out around the neck over a few days after washing so he has managed to wiggle his fingers out and put in his mouth. This is the best swaddle we have tried, but still not a life saver when it comes to helping him sleep as we were hoping for after reading some of the reviews prior to purchasing. He is not as restless throughout the night, but still waking every 2 hours on average. He might be approaching the 4 month sleep regression or a growth spurt. So who knows.

They were an absolute lifesaver and really made it easier for me to keep my baby snug and secure. As you can see from the photos he would knock out immediately when I swaddled him and even as he grew and became too large for the swaddle to fit over his arms I used to use it to kind of wrap around his chest so that he could feel like He was being hugged. He loved that feeling as well and it helped him sleep.

He was born 9lbs and 21\", and the small has worked well for now.The velcro allows you to adjust the swaddle so it's nice and snug and baby feels safe, but it holds tight so that they can't break out as easily. My little guy has been much happier while swaddled, and these have held up well to the usage.

I'll post the same review under each product, but to be clear, they have different dimensions. The Ultralight Long is a little thicker (2mm), and is larger (6 feet long & slightly wider @ 29 inches x 72 inches). The standard Ultralight is thinner (.5mm), and is smaller (just under 5 ' 7\" @ 24 inches x 68 inches).I own at least a dozen yoga mats, literally, and have purchased several compact, folding and travel mats. These YOGO mats are now my go-to mats. They have great grip, are very well designed and durable, are eco-friendly and made of plant-based materials, are easy to clean (they don't absorb water, and you just rinse and hang in the shower with the built-in straps/loops), are very compact (see photos and video - they'll literally fit in a large purse or under your car's seat), and are very reasonably priced.For context, I practice Bikram (Hot) Yoga weekly, and will occasionally attend a Vinyasa or traditional (non-hot) yoga class with my husband. I always keep a yoga mat in my car and in my office. My traditional (roll-up) yoga mats have frustrated me becuase they're big & bulky )they get in the way in the car, and I often have to take them out to make room in my car (eg. baby stuff, strollers, car-seats tend to take priority), which has left me at the yoga studio many times without a yoga mat becuase I forgot to put it back in my car. I don't like paying to rent yoga mats; besides being frugal, they're always gross and smelly. Plus, every roll-up mat puts nasty germs, bacteria and gross stuff from the studio/other people on the surface I lie/practice on just by nature from rolling them up when done. These mats fold up in a way that ALWAYS keep the yucky stuff from the bottom, on the bottom. The way you fold it keeps the 'bottom' and the 'top' isolated. This is particularly important to me as I often practice in hot (102-degree) and humid yoga studios, which have nasty floors (despite the studio owners' best efforts.)I've bought and compared these to folding and 'travel' mats made by Gaiam, Manduka (Mandua eKo SuperLite Travel Yoga & Pilates Mat), Navris Foldable Yoga Mat, Khataland YoFoMat, and Toplus Travel Yoga Mat. These YOGO mats are my favorite and the only ones I've kept and use. I talk a little bit about this in my video review (attached).These are very durable, have great grip (and don't require 'broken' down or 'worn' down like Gaiam & Manduka mats), are clean and easy to clean, and are wonderfully compact and portable. I spent an embarrassing amount of time researching and trying out other yoga mats, and just hope my review helps others in a similar situation. Namaste!\n","id":"cf4dc6b5-16d5-46d6-821c-723600ec42b2"},{"text":"\n  If you are looking for an incredible yoga mat, look no further. Seriously. I have been doing yoga for about 3 years now and have had various mats through that time. Most if not all would always require me to use a knee pad to avoid that pain.  A few months back, I bought a cloth top yoga bag, it was huge! I take with me to every yoga class and it is perfect!Well, now I am going on vacation and will not be able to bring the yoga mat that I bought and love. I found this, read some reviews and thought I'd give it a shot with Amazons excellent return policy, how could I lose.I have used this mat about 5 times now and will be putting it through its paces. So far, this thing is incredibly sticky, I DO NOT have to get the top wet (like my cloth one) to stick to it. It just works!  I do not need any padding for my knees in various positions.  As thin as it is, it is PERFECT to avoid ANY pain in my knees.  I take it to work with me in my laptop bag and knock out a quick 45 minute yoga session during lunch in my gym at work.  I NO LONGER have to touch the stinky mats that this whole building uses, yuck!As far as weight, I barely notice carrying it.  My laptop is heavier. I wish I could give this product 6 stars.  I am so glad I found it.As good as this mat is, I am even considering replacing my larger one with this one. Its that good!  My next tests will be taking it to the beach and see how well it does with sand and then getting a rinse.Pros:- Sticky, I don't slip on the mat- Doesn't move- Doesn't slip on the floor- Perfect size for me (5' 9\") - I bought the long one.- Small size (when rolled up)- Fits in my laptop bag- Not heavy at all, will be perfect for travelling- Great for taking on my bike- Folds up so the side I use for yoga NEVER touches the ground (EXCELLENT IDEA).Cons:- Stinks, I washed and aired it out.

You can also see it next to my foot (size 10 shoe).Taking it to the beach is next, we'll see how well it handles sand.\n","id":"3c097d82-3e78-419e-93fb-09e7131a729b"},{"text":"\n  I counted.

She was really excited at first and we sat down at the table to look through the book together. The illustrations are great....but that’s about it. She wanted to make a landspeeder, and we got about four steps in before we set the paper aside to try something easier. We read through the “basics” at the beginning but even the basics were pretty difficult?! So we decide to try a light saber. How hard could that be? We couldn’t even finish the light saber either. Mind you, I am a college educated individual with two degrees and I have some experience with origami (little animals and such) but no luck here. The instructions were vague and would go from a basic “mountain”or “valley” fold to a supremely difficult fold with no explanation as how to get from #1 to #2. This book is definitely not for a little kid or even most adults. We’re going to try again when her dad is home from work and maybe he’ll understand the instructions better.

Picture examples would skip steps without any explanation, and many folds for even the beginner steps were very difficult to fold. There is just no way these are for grade level 3-4 or for beginners. It's a fun \"puzzle\" project but many steps are not explained well at all. I think if the steps had shown the actual PRINT of the model you are folding, it would have made all the difference. But instead it is solid red, so it's hard to orient exactly what it's supposed to resemble in certain steps. The real print shown in each would have been much, much better.It's also weird that the papers are all compiled in the back without being numbered so you have to flip through to find the pages you need. I don't understand why they didn't just go in order based on difficulty, or even group the pages you are folding along with the chapter of corresponding directions. The book feels extremely disorganized for seemingly no reason.I will say the prints are neat, so once you finally at least sort of figure out how to put one together, there is a real sense of accomplishment. It has potential but I can't recommend it to anyone that isn't already experienced in origami. I guess for the reasonable price, it's a way to practice and spend hours of your time as a side project.\n","id":"3f808706-a6c8-4dbd-937f-8be4f9193444"},{"text":"\n  Don't buy this for kids--and not for any adults who do not have a lot of experience in origami.

Even the easier puzzles are _interesting_, however, and are enjoyable to solve even if they aren't _challenging_.My one gripe with the game is the printing: it seems the manufacturer doesn't have a clear sense of how origami works: the paper is thick and glossy (which is a very poor match for paper folding, preventing several folds from stacking upon themselves!), each page has margins around it (which prevent some of the more complex folds from being accomplished without tearing the paper), and so on. These issues may be worked around and don't seriously impact the puzzles themselves, but I found it frustrating nonetheless to see an otherwise excellent product diminished in it's realization.\n","id":"9459d507-2caa-4fc8-8cd2-33235a1df601"},{"text":"\n  You will not want to share a single one of the 100 puzzles in this box.

I had the Gaiam travel mat for a few days now. Here are my observations:  The Gaiam is not as sticky as the Yogo mat. I'd say the Yogo is easily twice as sticky as the Gaiam, if not a little more so. And by sticky, I mean good sticky. I think they are similar thickness to each other, but maybe the Gaiam is a touch thicker, however I think the material of the Yogo might be a little more comfortable to use. Thickness IS important, but it is not the only metric of what makes a cushion to be cushiony. The materials and how they react to pressure are a big part of  a mat's function.  It is true that the Yogo folds up to less width, but the depth is doubled in that shape, so the width issue is relative to depth. The Gaiam is 12x10x1, so if you folded it again it would be very similar to the Yogo dimension. While these two mats actually take up similar volume, the Yogo is more manageable because it can be folded into a newspaper shape. And it is more flexible so it will conform to contents of luggage when it is being squished with a compression strap. I tried folding the Gaiam once more into the shape of the Yogo, but it is so much more tough and does not stay in that shape. i considered getting some straps to hold it that way, but it is awkward, and would crease the mat.  My Yogo Mat is actually more like 12x4.5x2... not 12x5x2, which means it takes a little less space than advertised. Even though the Gaiam is really technically not much smaller than the Yogo, I think the Yogo is much more efficient in the way that it consume space, and it is more manageable., and seems more comfortable to use. If you want to lay it flat like the gaiam, you can, but it's advantage is to fold it up again into its intended shape for small bags. I highly recommend the Yogo mat. Everything about it screams quality, and I agree it is the best travel mat there is, but I wanted to cover some of the missing aspects of this comparison that nobody else on the internet would cover.  I think the Gaiam would be a reasonable mat for travel (for the price), but it is less sticky and the hands slide, and  it is not always adequate for very constrained luggage space. If you were checking luggage, you probably have space for the Gaiam. If you're doing carryon and traveling for a month at a time, get the Best you can. That is the Yogo.\n","id":"74e14aa9-6e2f-453d-95de-640080014044"},{"text":"\n   I bought two YOGO mats - the Ultralight Long Yoga mat for my husband, and the standard Ultralight for me. I'll post the same review under each product, but to be clear, they have different dimensions. The Ultralight Long is a little thicker (2mm), and is larger (6 feet long & slightly wider @ 29 inches x 72 inches). The standard Ultralight is thinner (.5mm), and is smaller (just under 5 ' 7\" @ 24 inches x 68 inches).I own at least a dozen yoga mats, literally, and have purchased several compact, folding and travel mats. These YOGO mats are now my go-to mats. They have great grip, are very well designed and durable, are eco-friendly and made of plant-based materials, are easy to clean (they don't absorb water, and you just rinse and hang in the shower with the built-in straps/loops), are very compact (see photos and video - they'll literally fit in a large purse or under your car's seat), and are very reasonably priced.For context, I practice Bikram (Hot) Yoga weekly, and will occasionally attend a Vinyasa or traditional (non-hot) yoga class with my husband. I always keep a yoga mat in my car and in my office. My traditional (roll-up) yoga mats have frustrated me becuase they're big & bulky )they get in the way in the car, and I often have to take them out to make room in my car (eg. baby stuff, strollers, car-seats tend to take priority), which has left me at the yoga studio many times without a yoga mat becuase I forgot to put it back in my car. I don't like paying to rent yoga mats; besides being frugal, they're always gross and smelly. Plus, every roll-up mat puts nasty germs, bacteria and gross stuff from the studio/other people on the surface I lie/practice on just by nature from rolling them up when done. These mats fold up in a way that ALWAYS keep the yucky stuff from the bottom, on the bottom. The way you fold it keeps the 'bottom' and the 'top' isolated. This is particularly important to me as I often practice in hot (102-degree) and humid yoga studios, which have nasty floors (despite the studio owners' best efforts.)I've bought and compared these to folding and 'travel' mats made by Gaiam, Manduka (Mandua eKo SuperLite Travel Yoga & Pilates Mat), Navris Foldable Yoga Mat, Khataland YoFoMat, and Toplus Travel Yoga Mat. These YOGO mats are my favorite and the only ones I've kept and use. I talk a little bit about this in my video review (attached).These are very durable, have great grip (and don't require 'broken' down or 'worn' down like Gaiam & Manduka mats), are clean and easy to clean, and are wonderfully compact and portable. I spent an embarrassing amount of time researching and trying out other yoga mats, and just hope my review helps others in a similar situation.

I ended up modifying a lot of poses because it felt very unsafe. In summary - this is probably a great mat if you're on a beach or don't sweat very much. It didn't work for me at all.

I also ordered purple yoga jellies because I have sensitive knees and wrists because I was worried about using such a thin may. I'm glad I did, the jellies are great with this mat. There is very little cushioning, but the pack ability was what is most important to me. The rolling mats are too big for my carry on and so this is perfect. The folds don't bother me as much as I thought they would.I wish there were more colors to pick from. The purple is okay but not really my style. It's growing on me, but I would have loved a bigger selection.Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better mat.

While the fabric does drape upwards when he stretches his hands up, it didn’t block his airways. About a month after purchase, we’ve transitioned him to one arm and then both arms free. The arm holes were a real saving grace as it let us slowly transition him and while we still use the swaddle as part of his bedtime routine, he is not relying on being swaddled as a sleep crutch (which is what dissuaded me from the other swaddles like the zipadee zip).

It’s perfect for adults and kids alike. Gameplay is simple: one person draws a Danger card which outlines their peril and everyone else acts as rescuers. The rescuers draw a variety of tool and skill cards which help them outline their rescue strategy. The Dangers are clever, the Tools and Skills cards are often hilarious and your story can be woven into anything you imagine. Plot twist cards were a brilliant addition and we had fun piling them on, one after another, to a single player. Tonight we played Danger as a family but this game would work extremely well as an adult’s game night choice.

It was a lifesaver at first since it prevented her from the Moro reflex. However, now that she started to move her hands better, she keeps moving it up and the fabrics block her mouth and nose. It’s somewhat frightening at times when she does that and sleeps for a longer period of time. I tried taking out her arms, but then she doesn’t sleep well.

I absolutely love this swaddle! My son has demanded to sleep with his arms up since in utero and was growing so quickly so I knew we needed a swaddle that would allow his arms to be up, fit him for longer than 2 weeks and grow with us for when he rolls and can no longer be swaddled (which happened very quickly at 3 months). While the fabric does drape upwards when he stretches his hands up, it didn’t block his airways. About a month after purchase, we’ve transitioned him to one arm and then both arms free. The arm holes were a real saving grace as it let us slowly transition him and while we still use the swaddle as part of his bedtime routine, he is not relying on being swaddled as a sleep crutch (which is what dissuaded me from the other swaddles like the zipadee zip). Our daycare does not allow swaddles so it was important to us to ensure it didn’t remain a sleep crutch.

I will begin my review with the physical attributes of the book.  The hardcover edition sports a gorgeous cover page.  The book is sturdy, and VERY importantly, the book binding allows the pages to open FLAT.  This is important if your hands are full of dye and can't hold down the pages.  The paper is not glossy, such that your light source is not reflecting light back into your retina.  The font is small, so if you have a problem with small print, you may need to also get the Kindle edition.THE CONTENTS:1) The author begins with very detailed discussion on types of crepe paper as this is the main material used in this book.  Also, tips for working with crepe paper and materials are elaborated.  Next, she details the basic techniques e.g. cupping, fringing (author states it's her \"strong suit\") spindling, paper staining to name a few.  The techniques are paired with photographs.  The photographs are so detailed and CLOSE-UP that you can see the grain of the paper.2) The flowers and instructions included in this book are:  Bougainvillea  Carnation  Daffodil &Double Daffodil.  Japanese Form Peony  Morning Glory.  Hybrid Tea Rose.  Iceberg Floribunda Rose.  English Rose two ways  Perle d'Or Rose.  California Tree Poppy.  Chocolate Cosmos.  Garden Cosmos  Oriental, Iceland, and opium Poppies.  Dandelion.  Coneflower.  Eucalyptus  Marigold.  Pom-Poms.  Zinnias.  Dahlias.  Double Peony.  Coral Charm Peony  Ranunculus.  There are also leaf construction, buds, and yes, even instruction on making wilting flowers!3) There are also projects such as crowns, fascinators, daisy chains, boutonnières and garlands.4)  The Giant Paper Peony is stunning.5) The templates are hand-drawn and actual size.  No need to copy, enlarge (yes, even the giant Peony template is actual size). I'm not sure how you can copy if you get the Kindle edition, though.  She even borders the area on where to bleach.6) There are six pages of leaf templates.7) Lastly, the instructions are very detailed with step-by-step photos.The flowers appear very realistic.  Obviously, these flowers are not something you throw together in 30 minutes.  It will take great care to imitate the real flowers.  I use photographs.  She recommends the actual flower.  This is not a book for beginners.  However, it can provide an excellent challenge, and you will have gorgeous flowers as your reward!

The sources for materials in the book are helpful. Be ready to drop a good amount of money into these babies. As a beginner I had to read the directions a couple of times before being able to find the clearest approach and streamline my process. I'd say at least for the giant flower one overall count of petals would be very helpful. The artist and author is generous to share her crafting skills but this a book for mid level to high level crafters.

I would consider this an instruction manual for more advanced artists and crafters, but there are plenty of tutorials appropriate a beginner, as well (the magnolia leaves are wonderful).The techniques alone make this book worth its weight in gold. Tiffanie gives instructions on how to color papers beautifully, how to use different glues to achieve different effects, and how to shape petals in a realistic manner.All that being said, the instructions can get a little wordy in places and I’ve had to read through different parts several times to figure out what the next step is. Making notes in the margins and on the template pages has been very helpful for me. If you can manage, taking a class with Tiffanie is helpful as well, as she can explain the steps in different ways and actually show you how to do it.Even if I wasn’t a paper flower artist, I would consider buying this book for the images alone.

They are so realistic they will take your breath away. Her level of craftsmanship and knowledge is what a paper artist aims for and, by writing this book, she is sharing a wealth of experience that must have taken many years of trials and errors.I read some of the reviews that say there are not enough instructions or photographs to follow - I disagree. I have the hard copy and the Kindle edition. (I do like the Kindle edition because you can enlarge the photographs - but that might be due to my aging eyesight). The instructions on each flower are carefully written and all of the materials she uses - right down to the weight of the crepe and color - are shared. However, you can be successful without having every exact paper. The photographs are detailed. Her templates alone are worth the price of the book.Think of Tiffanie Turner as the Depak Chopra of fine paper flower making. No one reads Depak Chopra as their first introduction to spirituality and \"gets it\". It's the same with Ms. Turner's book. You might not quite get the instructions at first, but with time and practice, it will eventually fall into place as confidence in your own skills improve.And, let me say this also, I have several other books on paper flowers - they all have their place on my shelf and I do refer to them from time to time and use them for some flowers and foliage. But \"The Fine Art of Paper Flowers\" is far and above those for realism, detail and technique. If you are looking for a higher level of art and craftsmanship in paper flowers, this is the book you need - beginner, or not.\n","id":"2c50f3c7-bc59-48c5-a851-2673b507802f"},{"text":"\n  Ordered this to be a Christmas present.

The skill levels vary from project to project; some quite simple, ranging to pretty complex.  I liked the variety of projects and my grandson has had a lot of fun with some of the more unusual ones.  While I don't think this would be appropriate for a beginner, I would highly recommend it for anyone with some skill looking for some unique folds.\n","id":"4492b58e-6a5e-42d3-b382-14498bf03fa8"},{"text":"\n  Great book for a more experienced folder. My daughter was enjoying making smaller items with the smaller origami paper, and seemed a little bored. So I bought her this book. WOW!! Lots of great projects, but it is definitely geared towards the more experienced folder. I would highly recommend this book for a teenager or adult. There is some pretty neat stuff in here. Many projects require multiple papers and there are quiet a few that are interactive (move). She really enjoys it when she can find PLENTY of time to sit down and actually figure a project out.\n","id":"5d82b9ab-fb0e-4825-a9b6-3bfac862f434"},{"text":"\n  Bought this for my 9&11 years old step children and they love it!  Best part is, there are so many activities inside that it's been a full year and they haven't even done a third of them.  The instructions are clear and the end results are truly amusing.  It's difficult to find mental challenging fun games for smart kids/ pre-teens so I highly recommend this product for all origami enthusiasts and parents looking for presents.\n","id":"33c44cc0-789b-40ea-9104-83a498c25e63"},{"text":"\n  My 5-year old granddaughter loved this. There were so many animals to make, I think it would be suitable as a craft for a birthday party. Granted half of them already had the features printed on them, but they all required folding. The kit kept us both busy for an hour or more.  I wanted to introduce my grandaughter to Origami with this kit just to teach the basics. I think Djeco is one of the most imaginative makers of children's craft projects out there. I've bought almost all of them for one grandchild or another, depending on their ability.

I had read that origami can be good for strengthening spatial learning and thought this would be good introduction to this art form.  There are 6 different animal faces. Each animal has 2 papers with the face printed on it and 2 papers with just the basics of the face allowing places for the stickers to be placed for eyes, mouth, nose, whiskers, etc. Each paper sheet has dotted lines along each fold. My son just did his first two papers (1 cat paper with the printed face & then 1 cat paper without the printed face) and was so excited to finish them! There is a little booklet included that is an excellent pictorial guide to showing how each step is done! There was some frustration on my son's part with folding some of the lines but I expected this since it is a new skill.

That said, I had thought that I would be able to use one end or the other to score the cardstock where I wished to fold it. That only sorta works? Neither end has enough of a point to accomplish that effectively, and I still get a less-than-perfect finish on the outside of the fold when I am done making my card. It is better than my prior method of simply using my hands, but I think that there is likely a better way.

I four starred this due to the fact that I have never made any of the models look great. Don't get me wrong, I've been doing origami almost 9 years now. I can make almost anything and it would look amazing. That being said, a description on paper types used would be so useful here. I feel like I was always choosing wrong for the models. Thick papers worked great on very few models but none of the complex. Yet the complex models had really poor locking systems and model collapse was very normal. I'd say if you plan to display these and never touch them go for it. Don't plan on putting one inside a box and handing to someone though, you will need to reshape immediately.\n","id":"2041df0a-00c9-469e-afec-191d6d72ea59"},{"text":"\n  What I like about this book is the range of kusudama types. There are geometric and floral in a single book, whereas typically, origami books are about one or the other.One of the things that sets this apart from several of the modular origami books I've purchased recently by newer authors is that the diagrams are as thoughtful as the models themselves. The illustrations are simple and clear, even for the more complex constructions. (There is nearly nothing more frustrating than getting halfway through a module only to find that the instructions stop making sense.)I also like that while there are models in here that would be easy for beginner folders to understand, she has models that would challenge more nimble folders.As a folder, the best part about this book to me is that a few of the models evolve off of a single module idea, showing the versatility of a single concept and how it can transform. This concept keeps me curious and trying new methods of construction, and in this way, it is mentally challenging beyond what's on the pages.\n","id":"0cf8ab97-4564-4d9f-808a-33a974e81e96"},{"text":"\n  I gave this 5 stars because it is a beautiful book with clear instructions.That said, just a note: these kusodama mostly do not lock together like other kinds of unit origami.

I have other origami cases for my old Paperwhite that fold so firmly i can use the fold as a handle when reading, so that was a disappointment.  I think it's because the material within the cover is too thick and requires more force to properly hold. you'll see that in the weight of the case - between the heavy cover material and the thick plastic backing, I'd say it doubles the weight of the oasis when using it.

It is the one that I recommend the most to people who have just started out in origami and have mastered simple models, and are looking to grow their skills with more complex ones. It is not easy to find simple-to-moderate complexity origami models that still look so closely like the real world animal or creature on which they are based. This book is filled with models that all look fantastic, and that makes it a great learning tool for newcomers: just enough complexity to challenge you, not so much that you get discouraged, and satisfying results when you are done. What's not to like?The photos are big and beautiful. The instructions are about as clear as can be, and are also printed nice and large so that they are easy to follow. For the more challenging folds that can't easily be represented in line drawings, there is the DVD to help teach you.I love this book so much I bought the Kindle version, too.

The DVD's are the biggest asset as they make it possible to understand folds that may have been difficult without seeing them done first hand. I also have the first Origami Butterflies kit written by Michael G LaFosse.  I loved the fact that it came with papers, but the folds were sometimes difficult to understand.  So this was a great idea on the author's part to come out with this book that not only shows the folds in the book, but a DVD as well if you have difficulty following the written directions like I did. The completed butterflies are works of art.I experimented with some different papers to see what would produce the best results.  My favorite was a butterfly that I made using tissue paper thin mulberry paper.  I used two different colored sheets and folded them as one and the result was gorgeous.  I am a scrapbooker and have a lot of different papers on hand, so it was fun to experiment. I did find the thicker papers were harder to produce a nice crisp butterfly.\n","id":"a2337a8c-071a-4ca0-8407-f03ea563d294"},{"text":"\n  This book is a big thumbs up all the way ‘round. Visually, it’s a treat, even if you never make a butterfly! But don’t stop there, because this is a ‘can-do’ book. The written instructions are very clear, but the DVDs make it a near-perfect purchase. First of all, it’s fun just to watch and listen to the instructions. Then, if you get stuck on a project, just go to the instruction you need, and it all becomes clear. The first 4 butterflies I made, I didn’t even use practice paper, just jumped right in with the good stuff, and they are all lovely. With some of the later ones, I used practice paper first. Another origami book with a DVD is Origami 101 by Benjamin Coleman. I’m an “advanced beginner to low-intermediate” and I can get all the way through those two books. I’ve invested in other origami books, more advanced, and often got lost after the first several projects. A DVD  with those – and better written instructions – would have helped a lot to advance me to mid-intermediate.I’ve made butterflies previously, using other instructions, but somehow they never came out exactly right because the instructions were not as clear as these. Something I really appreciate is that after the first butterfly or so, Mr. LaFosse doesn’t assume you’re a pro, he continues to provide the same good instructions as in the first project with additional helpful hints along the way. I found one little boo-boo: The written instructions for the Jan Polish butterfly leave out the inside reverse fold after step 14. The DVD includes it.It would be great if the author included papers like those he used; but of course that would raise the cost of the book by a good deal since his creations use archival paper, hand-made paper, special fine art paper, acid-free paper, etc. You can find a wide variety of good quality paper, and maybe it won’t last a lifetime, but it will last long enough. Still, it would be nice....... But look out -- you’ll want to buy more and better origami paper as you get more proficient. This book would make a nice gift for your origami friends!\n","id":"e3ad53c3-b03d-47fd-82fd-1a1fe3448566"},{"text":"\n  The thing I like about this book is that there is room to get \"individual\" once you figure out the base of this great origami butterfly design. But on the other side, there is a good variety of different styles already designed for you to copy. After you fold these examples, it's pretty easy to figure out some variations for yourself.Also, it's hard to \"mess up,\" since the result will basically just be different color variations no matter what you do.It's exactly what I wanted: an attractive butterfly design to make for my friends.It's more than I wanted: there are moth designs I like, too.Then, there's even *more* that I want: the option to get creative and come up with my own (with relative ease based on the foundation designs) once I grow tired of the ones I liked right at the start.Great book!\n","id":"3e449406-c660-4394-91f9-43b95e5cb17d"},{"text":"\n  I love the book, but the Kindle version does not allow you to zoom in on the diagrams, only the text.

The outer carbon fiber has a really nice textured feel and look.  The inner portion of the cover is a nice felt-like material (standard issue with most cases like this).  The backing is has a nice smoked colored, translucent design and has 2 different textures/materials.  The flat portion is a matte texture and the outer edges are a smoother material with little give to it.  This also allows the on/off and volume buttons to be covered as well.This is my 3rd Origami case for the 2017 iPad and each of the 3 had their own Pros and Cons:Brand \"F\"Pros-Lowest selling priceNice leather-type materialGreater use of magnets - back of the case has integrated magnets that keep the front cover against the back of the cover when not closed (when closed it uses the magnet in the iPad)Cons-Back cover edges are rigid plastic and mine broken in multiple places rendering the cover no longer securely holding the iPad - hence the need for a replacement.  (My child has this case on his iPad and hasn't had this issue, despite him dropping his iPad numerous times)Brand \"R\"Pros-Slim macking is solid plastic, but thicker than that of Brand \"F\" (probably not as brittle too)Origami design works really well.Cons-Magnet on the front cover was weak and cover was floppy when closed and didnt hold well as a stand either.No magnet on the back cover.Inside top cover was felt and not the material in the pictures and in the previous generations.Returned this as the cons definitely would bother me, especially since I had the same case for the Air 2 and it didnt have these cons.KhomoPros-Carbon Fiber material is really nice and not offered by the others.Tranlucent back is a nice visual touch.Polyurethane edges of back cover offer more cushion than the others.Front cover magnets are strong and arent floppy when close and solid when folded as a standCons-Highest price of the 3Doesn't have magnets on back cover (but doesn't hinder performance as a stand or when closed flat.  Folded cover does swing when picked up though)The Khomo would have been perfect if it had magnets on the back cover, but I dont think its possible given its translucent backing.  To me, the carbon fiber cover material and and the urethane edges are the back cover out weight that negative though.\n","id":"55e2f9d9-7a64-460d-a566-b395824ec7f1"},{"text":"\n  It is lightweight, and actually fits my Ipad (2017).

The book shows some lovely flowers.  I found the written/pictorial instructions very hard to follow (I am a novice at origami so that's probably partly on me).  I did use the book to find video instructions on line.  The papers do not seem to be good quality at all, much inferior to other papers I have bought online.  Most of the papers are 2\" square, very small to do the kind of folding required for the flowers, especially with paper that does not fold well.  The DVD did not work on my computer...will try on the TV.  For the price, I found it lacking.  I saw a lot of positive reviews before I purchased it, so maybe part of the fault is with me.  That's why I gave it 3 starts instead of 2.  I do feel I wasted my money.

I always like the DVD lessons that Mr. LaFosse includes with many of his books, they are such a help. The flowers are new (to me at least) except for the ubiquitous lily -- why even include that one? -- It's everywhere, although it is always lovely. My only gripe, really, is with the paper that's included. It's ordinary and actually not-all-that-good kami. I'm pretty sure that's not the paper Mr. L. used in demonstrating the models on the DVD. I don't expect him to send along the great papers he and Mr. Alexander produce at their studio, but jeepers, if you're going to hype the fact that paper is included, give us a break and make an attempt to include something a little bit special. And a bit crisper. The best models I've made from this book use paper other than what was included with the book.All in all this is a fun book, lots of neat flowers. Good presentation and helpful hints on the DVD (be sure to look at that as there is lots of help not included in the book).
