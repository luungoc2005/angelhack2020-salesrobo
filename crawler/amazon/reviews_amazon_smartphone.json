I've bought and used several kits over the years, CV bends under high stress situations, typically with the flat head bits, these don't. The last kit I bought had a dark copper/cherry colored coating that masked the cheese quality bits. The first use of the pentalobe stripped the bit.Getting to this kit. It is complete, for the most part minus sockets. The driver is a bit too skinny, however it is a byproduct of the well packaged and self contained design. I just use the iFixit pro tech driver for daily use, and use the included driver for when I need to take it with me.I've been testing this one kit for the past 48 hours, it passes scratch tests, the only thing to be mindful of is stripping screws. S2 tool steel is great for the application of working on small electronics due to its hardness, just dont go around putting 650+ pounds of pressure on them with a hammer drill as S2 can shatter. Overall, packaging/container, is sturdy, even though magnetic holding tray is plastic. Also difficult to remove from the aluminum sleeve.This kit is the best kit for the price, available, when you get it, check all bits for squareness and alignment as I have a rarely used square bit that cock-eyed, but its rarely used so who cares. The same repairs with the same screws I've dealt with for years, are now smoother and the bits lock into the screw heads more securely, its a surreal feeling. It feels like Wiha drivers.I bought one, and just ordered two spares, its worth the extra cost for durability when you are doing more than a few repairs a week.\n","id":"c81593fc-aa1f-4762-ba7b-2052026bb2c3"},{"text":"\n  Oh yeah baby. Looking forward to using this set. Looks like quality stuff right here.Edit: one of the flathead bits was defective when I got the set. Tried to grind it into something usable but the metal is so soft I wound up just throwing it away. -1 star for the manufacturing defect.\n","id":"063afc44-e3a0-48b9-b249-6e7fbce68a0d"},{"text":"\n  This tool set is convenient for many tech and hobbyist uses. Unfortunately, the tool tray has inferior markings on the bit's slots. This doesn't affect the bit's usage, but it can slow you down when you need to choose a particular bit. Many of the bits have a similar profile and the slot markings could quickly tell you the difference between several if they were legible. I returned the first set I received because of this. The replacement was only marginally better. My included photo is of the better replacement. I have a nearly identical set I bought a number of years ago that has perfect markings, so I know it can be done. It's a different brand though. I have been unable to find another and was excited to see this one on Amazon. After receiving it I was disappointed.\n","id":"ba3bdb3e-cc22-40b2-ac7b-01f6664fe765"},{"text":"\n  First the bad news, I had to get two of these to get a full set. The first order was missing one bit. Amazon was great on exchange even in a pandemic and the second one was fine. Overall it is a solid kit with some flaws keeping it from being perfect. The release catches a lot of times and you have to pry it open. I realize you want the thing to be secure but this is overkill, my Xiaomi kit manages to push and release every time. Another issue with these is the labels on the bits have varying degrees of legibility, some the print is nice and deep and others it's barely etched in at all. So you have to make sure you are eagle eyed when you put them back. The parts themselves are quality and will probably last a good while but due to the previous issues this is my secondary kit in use at the moment.\n","id":"15fde043-1147-4d6a-9202-735055958a22"},{"text":"\n  Multi function tool with many many bits of screws.

The anime has to cut out details to pack a lot of content into the season. Those details that you miss are really worth the time to read. IE Kohaku asks to stay by Touyo's side all of the time. Normally this is not possible since the summoned beast will consume the summoners magic to stay in the world. But Touyo has enough magic to keep a heavenly beast around all of the time. So from this one detail you can surmise that Touyo has amazing magic regenerative powers. The novels are light and the author actually types the books on his smartphone, kinda funny.

Furthermore, taking a movie via a handheld hovering technique is completely out of the question.  I’ve used a couple different inexpensive smartphone adapters for eyepieces, and they just do not deliver, largely due to the difficulty in lining up the camera’s lens with the sweet spot of the eyepiece.  I think the Celestron NexYZ is really the best sub-$100 product to address this issue.The NexYZ is made of a lot of different plastic and metal components.  The metal components seem solid, while the plastic components, not including the knobs, feel kind of cheap.  I’m guessing this was to make the unit as light as possible, since it will be hanging off of your expensive eyepieces.  There are a lot of moving parts in this small package.  The main clamp opens by depressing the outside lever, followed by positioning the clamp’s arms around your eyepiece and letting go.  Initially it’s a loose hold, but you can quickly tighten the clamp by spinning the orange knob that you see on the right in the pictures.  This will lock the NexYZ in place.  From there you have to gently open the smartphone holder by pulling the spring-loaded slider on the left of the device.  Slide your phone in and slowly allow the slider to grip your phone.  The face of the holder that interfaces with the back of your smartphone is rubber, so it shouldn’t scratch anything.  Now you’re ready to line things up for image acquisition.At this point you’ll be doing a lot of fine tuning with the x, y, and z positioning knobs, which are all located on the rear of the NexYZ.  If you are using a monocular eyepiece telescope or microscope, hopefully you already positioned your subject in the field of view.  With a microscope, this isn’t much of an issue for fixed specimens or static cell cultures.  With a telescope, however, you probably want an equatorial or motorized mount that is tracking your planet or star of choice because it will take you at least 2 minutes to line things up with your phone on the NexYZ, and the planet or star probably moved out of your field of view by then.  Something to consider.  With an incredibly aligned finder scope you might be able to manage lining up a subject through the camera phone without finding it with your eyes and tracking with an EQ mount first, but it’s a significant challenge for anything other than the moon.  If you have a binocular eyepiece system, you can clamp the NexYZ on first, and still find your subject through the other available eyepiece.  With your phone clamped onto your eyepiece, you need to open your camera app and then try your best to line things up with the x, y, and z knobs. The knobs are well-designed, and they will slide your phone smoothly on metal tooth-strips guided by metal gears.  The NexYZ makes this alignment task as easy as possible – but be aware that it’s still probably not as simple or as quick as you want it to be.  While the clamp is pretty sturdy, I found that hitting the virtual shutter button on my phone’s screen caused enough vibration to result in blurred pictures.  I highly recommend setting the camera to a 3-second timer to get clear, vibration-free images.Clearly, there was a lot of thought that went into designing the NexYZ.  But there are a couple design quirks that prevent a 5-star rating.  First, the inside of the clamp has a thin layer of foam affixed by adhesive. The foam is really, really thin.  Like maybe a millimeter or two thick, at most.  After two days of use, I already have tiny nicks and impressions in that that foam layer that don’t give me a lot of confidence about its long term durability.  I’m already thinking about buying a thicker strip of foam with adhesive backing to solve this problem in the near future.  Next, there are two plastic ring adapters that you use to wrap around smaller microscope eyepieces which give the clamp something to really grab onto.  The plastic rings are cut on an angle on one side so you can kind of open up the ring a little to fit them onto the eyepiece.  Again, I’m not sure about the long-term durability of bending and opening these cut, hard plastic rings.  I would think a neoprene type of washer/ring would have done a better job.  Finally, the arms that directly hold your smartphone are somewhat limiting.  These are hard plastic arms (with an interior matte plastic finish) gripping your phone with a spring-loaded mechanism.  The hard plastic arms worked just fine to hold onto my iPhone 7 while it was inside a slim case, but I wouldn’t trust the arms to hold onto a case-less phone over and over again without eventually risking a scuff mark.  Thin foam on the inside of the arms seems like an obvious oversight here.  These problems can all be solved with $5 in hardware or craft parts, but still, with all the other fantastic design elements in the NexYZ, I’m sad Celestron didn’t go a bit further to perfect this product.Overall, I think the NexYZ is still, by a wide margin, the best smartphone adapter for the price for telescopes and microscopes.  I wouldn’t bother with the adapters that cost $25 or less…they will leave you wanting because those cheap adapters hardly allow you to smoothly line up your phone in the x and y directions, let alone provide any hope of finely tuning your z-axis alignment.  With a couple extra dollars in foam and neoprene, and some engineering ingenuity, you can modify the NexYZ to be a 5-star accessory for your imaging needs.There are small caveats that I feel I need to mention when it comes to smartphone imaging.  You need to have tempered expectations as to what your smartphone’s camera sensor can do, even with a steady camera mount.  To give you an idea of what you’ll get with a smartphone camera set to “auto” with the flash off, there are two attached images taken with an iPhone 7 mounted in the NexYZ.  One picture is Jupiter with a few moons captured with a Celestron NexStar 5SE and a Celestron 24mm-8mm zoom eyepiece at 12mm (about 100X magnification) with a mildly turbulent sky in a light polluted area.  The second picture shows a eukaryotic cell culture with a simple Nikon TS100 phase contrast microscope outfitted with a 20X achromat objective and 10X eyepiece.  The final caveat I’ll mention is that I only used an iPhone 7 to test the NexYZ at this point.  I have no idea how well it performs with a dual lens cameraphone like the iPhone X or Galaxy S9.  It may be a real challenge to align those types of phone cameras with most eyepieces that limit fields of view.UPDATE FALL 2018I used the NexYZ throughout the summer and into the fall and I still think it's 4-5 stars.  I did experiment with a few different adhesive foams to put into the clamp, which made some subtle improvements, but I haven't settled on the perfect solution.  There are a few things you should think about, though.  First, think about spending a few bucks on a good camera app where you can manually control exposure times.  Sometimes Jupiter or Mars are so bright that you can't make out details or pick up moons.  You can sometimes get better images with shorter exposure times, but then stack ten images together using Photoshop or other image processing programs.  Also, it is a challenge to get good pictures with short eyepieces (high mag).  Once I start using 9 or 8mm eyepieces, there just isn't a lot of eyepiece for the clamp to grab.  What tends to happen with those eyepieces is that your phone will weigh down the clamp and the camera lens won't be \"looking\" straight down into the eyepiece - it will be looking down into the eyepiece on a slight angle, which causes problems with the field of view and focus.My opinion is that this is still a good smartphone adapter, and I'll stick with my 4-star evaluation.  Just don't expect the NexYZ to be simple plug 'n play magic.  You will need to spend some time with it making subtle adjustments until you find positioning that works for you, your scope, and your phone.\n","id":"b7f47efd-5f60-44f9-bdc6-11d54d1dc2c5"},{"text":"\n  This item is so well designed, that it's hard to understand why they left such a fatal flaw: The mechanism simply cannot hold the weight of the phone in a steady position!

Whether it causes more benefits or issues; that is up to the individual. While it certainly has its pros, it’s best to not over-rely on technology. After all, many people seem to struggle with spelling; since there isn't an \"auto-correct\" function in real life.- Features: Contains English and Japanese audio, with English subtitles. The subtitles are white, as opposed to yellow (*cough Sentai *cough). The runtime is about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence, suggestive scenes, and fan-service.- Conclusion: I enjoyed this series. The protagonist is pretty common with the Isekai genre: In which he’s got a harem, kind-hearted, etc. But he does have some refreshing traits that other similar animes don’t have. Plus, it's interesting to watch how technology and information can vastly shape a world. Kind of like our own...Anyways, if you enjoy the Isekai genre, you’ll probably like this fun, and light-hearted anime, as well.- Recommendations: Akashic Records, Tales of the Abyss, Sky Wizards Academy, Kono Suba, Re:Zero, Grimgar, Armed Girl’s Machiavellism, Blade Dance of the Elementalers, High School DxD, K, Tokyo ESP, Code:Breaker, Needless, Black Bullet, and Gate.\n","id":"cbb9ea37-fced-4410-a1dd-c14e9995ff36"},{"text":"\n  This is a review of the blu-ray/DVD combo pack for \"In another world with my smartphone\". There are two blu-rays disk 1 has episode 1 - 9) and disk two has episodes 10 - 12. The DVDs are split into 6 episodes each. There are some extras but they aren't very special.An isekai anime is an anime where the protagonist is transferred from one world to another normally at the time of death or within an MMORPG. This genre of anime has been very popular for a few years but there seems to be a bit of a backlash now about the amount and quality of isekai anime. It was released in 2017 and contains 12 episodes.In this series Touya Mochizuki is killed by a stray lightning bolt. God has him resurrected and send him to another world with his stats increased and with his smartphone in full working order with seemingly infinite battery life. He quickly forms an adventuring team with Elze, Linze and Yae. They have a variety of adventures and Touya ends up engaged to the royal princess.This is a very light hearted, harem anime. The perils aren't very perilous, the humour is light and fast paced. The harem aspects and polygamy (yes, polygamy) are all present and correct too. It isn't very original but as an anime to watch when you want something light and funny it is ideal. I really enjoy this. I know it's a guilty please but I'm happy to be found guilty in this case. It won't be to everyone's taste but it is well worth watching if you like harem anime or isekai anime.

I bought this because I needed a relatively inexpensive scope to take camping and in situations where it could be damaged or stolen.  Overall, I am unhappy with the optical quality.  The large objective makes a very bright image this is great and why I picked it.  It seems fairly rugged for the price.  However, I find that it is only useful at the very lowest 20X magnification.  At that magnification, the images are pretty good.  However, the decrease in quality with increased magnification is very rapid.  It is not unusual for sharpness to degrade with magnification, but on this scope the degradation is dramatic.  It also suffers from significant  color fringing (chromatic aberration) that also, rapidly degrades with increased magnification. The focus control is quite coarse, so it is difficult to get a perfect focus.  Another disappointment is the \"eye relief\".  This is the distance the eye must be from the eyepiece.  On this scope, it is hard to see the whole field of view with glasses.  So, I recommend if you need need a bright image, but only at low magnifications.  It is a very poor performer for looking at the moon or planets, also.  I haven't checked it out on the shooting range, it might work out a little better there.\n","id":"6bcb65aa-df95-4753-9e0f-6cce2907b55a"},{"text":"\n  I picked up the Celestron 52250 80mm Ultimate Zoom Spotting Scope to use sighting in targets at 100 yards.  Previously, I purchased and compared three inexpensive 20-60X60 scopes.  The chromatic aberration and overall quality of those scopes was horrible.  The brands tested were SVBONY, ENKEEO and AOMEKIE all ordered from Amazon.  Don’t waste your time or money on any of those.The Celestron scope came well packaged with only one small ding and tear in the container.  This did not impact the contents.  It came with an instruction pamphlet, small lens cloth, and ocular lens inside a plastic tube hard case with it’s own separate nylon carry case.  The scope also comes with a nylon carry case however it’s not padded and would not provide any significant degree of protection against drops.  You can, however, still use the scope for viewing with the cover on by simply unzipping and exposing the objective and ocular lens.  I sorta like this feature.  The scope is waterproof and has a BAK4 prism according to the manual.  I was unable to find any verification either in the user manual or Celestron webpage that this scope is nitrogen or argon purged.The body of the scope appears to be a metal alloy with the rear portion rubberized. The ocular lens threads on to the body and can be stored separately in its own hard plastic tube as mentioned.  Eye relief is achieved by a rubber eyepiece grommet that you fold up or down.  The magnification ring on the ocular is smooth and crisp as was the focus knob.  The objective lens comes with a clip on style lens cap.  There is no pull out sun shade on the objective lens. That’s a bummer.I mounted the scope on a camera tripod to test it and immediately noticed the scope is forward weighted and tippy- in other words not balanced very well. Therefore using a sturdy tripod is critical with this scope.  The images from this scope were excellent considering the the price.  As with most scopes in this price range image quality at lower magnifications produce better views.  There was some chromatic aberration noted but nothing I would consider outrageous.  I believe it will do just fine as a range spotter and even a grab-and-go for  some light bird watching.Pros- Inexpensive, decent build quality, ability to swap out ocular lens, good “bang for the buck”.Cons- No sun shade on objective lens, non-padded carry case, forward weighted (tippy) design.Hope this helps.\n","id":"b838c14a-d3f5-49bd-8269-701de21e4651"},{"text":"\n  This is a good scope for the money, and much better than the other ones I looked at (the Barska Colorado 20x60 and the Vivitar Terrain 20x60).

Maybe Celestron has some QC problems but the clarity and brightness on my unit are much better than I expected.  My main reason for buying was to view bullet holes at 100 and 200 yards.  While I haven't been to the range yet, I have no doubt it will serve that purpose perfectly.  I can see cars moving on a bridge 15 miles away and can read a license plate at 2400 feet.On the negative side, the scope is a little cheap in places.  The threads on the eye piece are plastic and could easily be stripped by an impatient ham handed user.  Likewise, the objective lens cover locks in place but is pretty easily dislodged.  The included case has zero padding.  Some reviewers complained about no eye relief at 60 power.  This is true.  Glasses must be removed at higher magnifications.

The uv light only turns on when the lid is closed but there is a little bit of light leakage so I wouldn't sit next to it while in use (see photos and keep in mind this is dangerous since UV-C light causes skin cancer). The hole for the charging cable has a soft plastic that blocks the harmful uv light to leak when there is no cable being used. The product is entirely plastic except for the translucent glass surface you rest your phone on.The quality of Homesoap is a little nicer, perhaps because they didn't use that mirror like reflective plastic used inside Phonesoap Pro which reminds me of a cheap Chinese plastic product. The result is that it looks more refined and the emitting color of the UV light has a deeper darker navy blue tone to it. Homesoap has no light leakage, the only way to see the light is to open the door a few millimeters. Homesoap is also made entirely of plastic except for the translucent glass surface on the bottom.Both products leave a temporary smell on the objects you place inside but it goes away after a few minutes. I believe this is the smell of ozone due to the oxygen particles that are broken apart by the high-energy UV-C light.\n","id":"2ae18c33-9ec7-4375-a5e1-47bfd9af6829"},{"text":"\n  Enjoying my product but lighting bolt on top is now turning RED what does this mean?Seem to be working still but normal would shut off when it done now the Lighten Bolt stay on RED.Is there something wrong with my unit?\n","id":"40909f2c-76d2-465c-be18-873dd1b61765"},{"text":"\n  I bought this right at the beginning of our current Covid-19 pandemic.

First, this stylus is at least a half inch shorter than the others I have used. That may not sound like much, but as a man with an average sized hand, this stylus is too short. When I hold it like a pen, the stylus sort of disappears into the palm of my hand. I do not know why they made it so short. Second problem: the stylus unscrews easily - in fact, too easily. Actually, I am not sure what it unscrews at all. I find that the tip keeps coming loose, like every four or five times that I use it, and so I have to keep tightening it. Well, actually, this is so short that I find I do not use it as much as I would if the stylus were of a standard size. In fact, I have gone back to the old ones. Third reason, which goes back to the first, regarding its shortness: I made the mistake of inserting this into a pen slot or pocket, and it disappeared into the depth, so to speak, and I had to fish it out.As for the fiber tip: Nice.But the shortness and the looseness present annoying problems, that take away from the positives of the fiber tip.This stylus is not yet ready for \"prime time\" so to speak.\n","id":"7ab2e708-cf79-4688-8ce8-9e5ffbd2e92b"},{"text":"\n  (EDIT: Downgraded one star -- TL;DR: Stylus tip didn't last at all. After just a few uses, it became too unresponsive and 'squishy,' even with quite careful use. As there's no replacement tip option, I'm now on the hunt for a separate stylus.)I still feel the brush point is nicely responsive, but it isn't really helpful for use as a stylus (nor should it be -- that's not really the function.)---I read stylus reviews for a -long- time before I even purchased my tablet (Lenovo Tab 2 A10 -- 10 inch screen), since I had to special order my screen protector.  I chose this dual stylus because of positive reviews (here and on other websites) for brush quality/receptiveness and stylus quality/durability. The microfiber tip, while it was said to need a bit of a 'learning curve,' appealed to me as I really liked the idea of it being smooth compared to a rubber-tipped stylus and durable.  (I also did not want a disc-tip stylus -- it didn't seem practical and I thought I would probably find it cumbersome and annoying. I still think so.)When I first received it, I used before I had put on the screen protector -- stylus and brush both were very responsive. However, with the screen protector on (Mr. Shield, a standard screen protector thickness), it isn't nearly as responsive, especially for quick strokes or those that are less than perfectly angled and firm.  I'm just really not sure how useful it will be.With the firm touch required (as has been discussed in other reviews), I feel it starting to lose its original shape, and I have to make sure to turn it often so it doesn't deform more quickly.With the screen protector on, the brush tip isn't terribly responsive at all, and I'd hoped to use it for art purposes.I like the microfiber stylus...but I wish there was the option to purchase replacement tips.So, 3 stars: brush still ok, but stylus tip not terribly responsive once the protector is on.It was a bit of an expensive way for me to learn this lesson, especially without the ability to replace the microfiber tip.I'm disappointed, but I know it isn't entirely in the product -- it has to do partly with the screen protector (though it shouldn't).\n","id":"ab8d8a79-63d2-4795-8d6e-9aa5b714e70f"},{"text":"\n  i'm paranoid about scratching screens... i've had bad experiences, with regular RUBBER-tipped styluses.  And, my MS Surface RT (1st gen.) screen seemed somewhat non-sensitive.  i called computer stores near me, and none new anything about styluses with nibs made of MICRO-FIBER meshes.  So, relying on Amazon's generous return & refund policy, i purchased EVERY possible \"Prime\" eligible sort of stylus i saw, whose heads were made of micro-fiber mesh.  Now i know the following...Swift Summary plus Products to Purchase--------------------------------------------------------top two (2) types were the ones from AMPEN (\"hybrid stylus\") and WISDOMPRO (\"universal micro-knit fabric tip capacitive touch screen stylus with extra 2pcs replaceable tips\").  Both have replaceable tips, and reasonably-solid, sturdy, heavier feel to them.  Both have the highest-quality micro-fiber mesh i saw (along with the TruGlide Pro)... which is to say, their meshes had the tightest, densest weaves, a little like a dense denim (AmPen + WisdomPro) vs. looser knitted yarn (others).  Both were practically impossible to make to skip, on the Surface's screen, as tested utilizing the pre-installed, MS, \"Paint\", program.  Both came with \"kit\" including two types of lanyards, which can connect to a computer's head-phone jacks.  For a Father's Day gift, my father fancied the AmPen.  And, i wanted the WisdomPro.What about the others ?--------------------------------First, there are, overall, two (2) kinds / classes / sorts of styluses w/ tips made of micro-fiber mesh:  full micro-fiber mesh (all the way through, e.g. WisdomPro)  hybrids (= one layer of mesh stretched over regular rubber core, e.g. AmPen)Generally, the hybrids have a (somewhat) firmer feel.Second, there are \"clickable\" or \"click-pen\" kinds, whose heads can retract into the stylus body.  That requirement to retract back into the body of the stylus implies, that they have to have SMALLER tips / nibs.  Regular, non-retracting, tips are typically 10mm in diameter, whereas the retracting, clickable kind, are typically 6mm across.  Two IMPORTANT points...  specifically, the clickable kinds of styli have the same-sized bodies, but smaller-sized heads (and some even have screen-protecting pieces of plastic, wrapped around the end of the stylus body, to prevent screen scratchings, if people press too hard, and fully flatten out their smaller-sized nibs)... that can make the tips harder for the stylus-user to see...  generally, ALL touch-screen devices of which i'm aware have their touch-screens CALIBRATED for people's bigger beefier FINGERS... NONE of the smaller-tipped sorts of styluses worked as well, as the ones with full-finger-ish-sized nibs... for particularly prominent example, the pricy premium LynkTek TruGlide PRO (which was otherwise awesome) was never as steady & skip-free as the ones which i really recommend... EVEN when i took time to calibrate the computer, for that specific stylus (for Win8 RT, you must navigate to \"Control Panels\", choose \"Hardware\", and scan for the word \"calibrate\", and spend a minute or more gently pressing on cross-hairs positioned near the corners of the screen)Third, the touch-screen of a nearly-new Nokia Lumia 520 (AT&T Go-Phone) was super-sensitive, and experienced nearly none of the skipping i saw w/ the Surface RT, even with what i would rank as not-quite-so-good sorts of styluses.  There were a few styluses which seemed to skip allot, most in the middle which would skip sometimes, and a few seemingly-superior sorts which nearly never skipped (of which the top two recommended above skipped noticeably less than the rest).Ranks of the rest:-----------------------[top tier...]--------------(AmPen + WisdomPro)(Dokem) \"micro-fiber stylus & 2 color pen combo\"  the Dokem was as good as the others, although it slid a little less smoothly across the screen (felt harder to drag), and the others included \"kit\", like lanyards, with the WisdomPro also including a micro-fiber cleaning cloth (like you get with glasses), a seemingly-similar kind-of-cloth bag to safely store the stylus, TWO SPARE replaceable nibs (AmPen provides NONE), and even a nice note from WisdomPro Pres. \"Adam\" expressing gratitude for people purchasing his products... the Dockem does come with a PAIR of pens, buried in the body, which can be inter-changed[good solid seldom-skipping styli...]---------------------------------------------(Chromo-Inc) \"mesh stylus executive gift set\"(Zip) \"stylus capacitive 2-in-1 stylus ink pen combo\"(Friendly-Swede) \"bundle of 6 micro-knit hybrid fiber tip universal capacitive stylus pens 4.5\" \"  feel a little light, cheap, & plasticy, but work well, and by far the best possible PRICE... you'd have to have a hard-to-please screen, and be scribbling fairly fast, to start to see significant skipping(LynkTek) \"Tru-Glide Pro\"  heavy professional feel, obviously made of metal, smallest nib, perfect for weaving between small buttons & icons on a crowded screen, otherwise by far the best, pricey-but-premium... but PERFORMANCE in Paint-program test was inconsistent, even with stylus-specific calibration... did not work well on an iPad Air, either... does have other pricey-but-premium accessories, like an artistic metal carrying cases, and a professional paint-brush type of tip (look up the LynkTek website, if there are no appropriate product pages on Amazon)(Butter-Fox) \"micro-knit fabric tip capacitive touch screen stylus pen\"  see next...(Mee-Csse) \"diamond dual-purpose micro-knit technology capacitive stylus & roller-ball ink pen\"  BOTH of the above two types taper towards their tips... they both narrow & neck down, until their nibs are barely bigger than the pricey premium TruGlide Pro... both, especially the Mee-Case, have a heavier, made-of-metal, physical feel... but both suffered the same small-sized-stylus performance problems... like the Dockem vs. WisdomPro (above), the Mee-Case dig drag a minor-amount more than the Butter-Fox, which was buttery-smooth on the screen... were there a way to correctly CALIBRATE computer touch screens for smaller-sized styli, i would want one of them, probably the Tru-Glide Pro overall despite cost, and the Butter-Fox including cost concerns... smaller-sized nibs are much more precise to position(Box-Wave) \"EverTouch quick-click\"  best of the clickable kind, would work well for most people, PROBABLY... does have NO screen-protecting piece of plastic wrapped around the tip (as do BOTH of the other click-pen kinds i tested, namely the New-Trent's & Yoo-Me's)[these styli are starting to skip somewhat (and more-and-more...]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(New-Trent) \"Arcadia 2pcs click-pen\"(Yoo-Me) \"retractable two-pack black & white fiber mesh capacitive touch-screen stylus\"(Great-Shield) \"TAP series fiber-mesh capacitive stylus\"(Glidex) \"2pcs LCD touch screen styli with high-quality conductive mesh cloth fiber\"(Caseseen) \"VIBE extra long stylus\"  un-wield-ly long, practically like a CHOP-STICK, not-bad-but-mediocre performance(Sanoxy) \"clicker retractable stylus pen with microfiber fabric tip\"(Mee-Elec) \"Diamond dual-purpose micro-knit technology capacitive stylus & fine roller-ball ink pen\"  NOT (exactly) the same as the Mee-Case kind (above), these are indeed a degree different, and look like (and feel lighter, like) doe sort of imitation knock-off of the Mee-Cases, which i liked allot\n","id":"10e2b35d-1b69-41de-b4f2-5a35f9010af9"},{"text":"\n  I have used this product for my Elder one.

I thank God for this book and how it's helped equip me to be a better parent in this tech-savvy and media-saturated generation!\n","id":"8f2fa43b-acd1-496a-aaee-26ec5ba26cbb"},{"text":"52 Ways to Connect with Your Smartphone Obsessed Kid: How to Engage with Kids Who Can't Seem to  Pry Their Eyes from Their Devices!","id":"3235d9f5-c903-47a0-b405-8043163d0efb"},{"text":"\n  As I was reading it occurred to me that this will be a great resource for parents, particularly those who are really struggling to find ways to be engaged with their children. I was also a little saddened that a book of this nature even needed to be written. This is something that should come naturally to us, but the truth is being connected to our kids is becoming more and more difficult because of rapidly changing technology and the great “distraction factor” that comes along with those changes, particularly smartphones and the ever invasive social media platforms.This book addresses that very issue, and offers some very helpful advice to help us avoid losing the connection that our families truly need. I really liked the short chapters with anecdotal stories to introduce each topic, the challenge of addressing the issue as well as the questions to ponder. It makes for an easy read. It flows nicely, I never felt bogged down or that I was being taken on a guilt trip for my failings as a parent. They are bite sized suggestions, easy to digest and not an overwhelming amount of information or suggestions that can sometimes leave your head spinning. In fact, as I stated above, I think this book will be a very helpful resource for parents, so, if you are a youth worker buy yourself a copy and maybe a small stack of them for the parents of your group members. And if you are a parent (if your Youth Pastor doesn't buy you one) get one and perhaps get another, for a friend who is also trying to navigate the sometimes stormy waters of raising Godly teens. I think it will help.\n","id":"4c43bfcf-d3f5-4d65-905e-162beae26e29"},{"text":"\n  After pouring over all the offerings out there for \"Affordable\" LED projectors, that support a larger resolution,  I stumbled across this little gem.  I use it mostly in presentations to a cub scout den, and really fits the bill.  I've pulled up web pages, and could clearly make out the text for almost all the page I pull up.  A little zoom, here and there for the tiny fonts is occasionally needed.  This can easily handle the large powerpoint fonts with ease.The speakers are meh,  so I use a couple of small wired can speakers that I've had for years, if I project anything requiring good sound.

I decided to try my luck. I'm glad I did.!  I'm using it to project HD movies onto my 100-inch screen.  In addition, the built-in tiny speaker is surprisingly loud and clear/crisp enough for personal viewing.  Obviously I can't say this is comparable to the higher projectors that cost hundreds or even thousands if dollars but for something that's less than a 100 bucks, it's pretty difficult to complain..  So far it's meeting my expectation and I'm a satisfied owner..

I am now using it every couple of days when I start to feel things starting to tighten up again. All I can say is: this is a great product (though simple) that has been life changing for me. I have not been paid or given anything for this review. I am giving this review because this device has helped me.\n","id":"2d5e624b-d3e8-4cbf-ab08-9345035c86d8"},{"text":"\n  I am a heavy computer user and currently 50 yrs old. Masseuses call my shoulders rocks. One week into a big project, I developed back pain in the upper right area. Nothing new, but was surprised at how quickly it developed. Decided to be more proactive about fixing the issue with my back and spine (hump), so did some research online and came across the backpod.Week 1: Did two short sessions morning and night (~30 min each). The constant pain was relieved quite a bit after a couple of days. Showed obvious improvement in photo on day 7. Worked areas per instructions.Week 2: Evolved into one longer session (1.5hrs +). Spent more time around shoulder blades where I have persistent knots that developed over the years. Recall starting to have them in my 20s.Week 3: Continued to be diligent with daily use of the backpod though some sessions may only have been an hour. Started working from lower back where I have tightness and up spine, also spending considerable time around shoulder blades. Elongation of the spine can be seen in day 21.Week 4: From loosening areas on back, started feeling other areas that were still tight. Now I sometimes also carefully work around the whole back and even the ribcage at the sides/front.Week 5: Pretty much the chronic recurring pain and knots I have felt in the past has resolved. Back has loosened quite a bit.Week 6-7: Started skipping days and require less time using it. Graduated to using backpod at the sharper angle, horizontally. Focusing more on hump area.Day 60: Continuing progress is still happening but has been more gradual.Starting week 2, the time I spend each day using the backpod is quite a bit. I use it while watching/listening to tv shows and track time spent on each spot by doing a 10 count on each finger up to 10 fingers. Since I tend to count fast that ends up being somewhere over a minute on each spot. Low tech but does the trick. Covering a large area, I mostly don't repeat working on spots. Like with massages, it is a good to drink water afterwards to help flush out toxins released from the muscles.The big thing to note is that my initial results might be atypical or came quicker for the following reason: I prefer deep tissue massages that work through knots. The backpod allows me to do it on my own in a targeted fashion. So I work through the uncomfortable at times painful spots. You have control over how deeply you use the backpod. So it can be used in a gradual less painful way.Development after the first couple of weeks has become slower. It has been 60 days since I started using backpod. I have been skipping the occasional day and spending less time using the backpod. Due to the amount I work, it is more maintenance at the moment. At this point, I decided to start using a product that will work deeper into the my shoulders than the backpod, the Twin Block Pro by MassageBlocks. The backpod has been great to get me started. Now the rocks that are my shoulders need deeper work.My 84 year old father has had chronic back pain for a while and his spine has been curving from old age. Sent him a backpod, though wasn't sure he would use it. He uses it every few days and is getting better as well.Only taking a star off for the price going down to $69.99, when I bought two not so long ago for $84.99 each. But considering that it is price of one massage, still not bad.Tip: google \"how to get rid of a neck hump\"It is how I found backpod and you may find other helpful info / exercises.started using backpod 07.30.19. edited 09.28.19.\n","id":"ddf64085-1f64-4dcb-999b-8158a536d365"},{"text":"\n  I've had costochondritis for a year and a half and counting (got it from improper weight lifting form over the course of 10+ years) I've tried everything to relieve the pain, absolute nightmare injury.

The numbers are clear and bright making it easy to read. Be sure to have your feet on the metal circles for your full reading. I usually open the app when I weigh in because the app will sound when the data is received. The app works with GoogleFit but NOT Samsung Health so I just manually input my data myself. It is glass, but that makes it a lot easier to wipe down and clean. It also self calibrates and that is a HUGE plus! Have you ever had to manually calibrate a scale? Not fun! It supports multiple users. They can download the app to his/her phone or just have the app on one phone and add multiple users.It recommends replacing the batteries monthly and at first it may seem excessive.

When I put them in the scale didn't turn on. When I replaced them with regual Duracell batteries it turned on right away. I also noticed that my actual weight fluctuated between 153 and 151, I re-stepped on the scale about 10 to 20 times to see how much change there would be and after a while it finally evened out.

Still, I highly recommend for all parents. The projector indeed calmes baby down before sleep, the atmosphere is somewhat magical. It’s very convenient for trips. What we disliked is that we don’t have possibilibity of activating the stories at another smartphone if it’s already activated somewhere else. So, in our case, stories can be read only from an application at Mom’s phone and Daddy has no opportunity of reading to baby using his phone. That is inconvenient.\n","id":"e1d33272-4738-4adb-8b72-47d0c4aa829a"},{"text":"\n  When I first received the projector and the books, My daughter and I were excited, until we went to activate her 5 store books we bought.

Director Martin Scorsese, a student and ace documentarian of rock history, intuitively knew how large the Quiet Beatle's legend loomed.  Scorsese cleverly divides the film into two sections.  The first part devotes itself to George's role as the acquiescent sideman in the Beatles still acquiring his own voice within the band.  Sometime around 1967 Eastern Mysticism would capture George's soul and its impact not only on the band but popular music on the whole is inestimable.  Unfortunately egos and ambition within the band would cause its inevitable implosion.  Dusting himself off the breakup proved to be a new lease on life for George.  Songs that were rejected as not good enough for the Beatles were compiled on the masterful \"All Things Must Pass\" album.  He organized the Concert for Bangladesh which proved to be a case of good intentions stymied by poor management.  Later he delved into filmmaking among other successful ventures.  The thing that impresses most about Harrison is the friendships he forged and the genuine affection others had for him.  By all accounts a good husband and father which probably was a larger accomplishment in his mind than being a Beatle.  One quote from the film the stuck with me came from Ringo Starr stating the Beatles were like a square dependent on the strength of its four corners.

It is advertised as free, but you can't do much with the free version. You have to buy the app to be able to use it to use it to its full potential.

Overall, it's very easy to install, simply removing one of your mirrors and using the original jam nut to clamp it into the desired position.The case holds my phone (a Motorola Z2 Force) relatively well on smooth terrain, though due to it being only finitely adjustable, the phone is not held as tight as it could be, leading to an unnerving rattle on particularly uneven terrain that may make the screen hard to read. In my limited off-road use of the item, however, the stand rattled about in an extremely distracting manner, making the screen illegible, and caused the ball-joint for adjusting the phone's position to slide out of place, regardless of how tightly it was fastened.From a durability and product quality standpoint, it's about the best you'll get for the price. The plastic is light, and clearly not the best quality, but it serves it's purpose well and doesn't look too bad compared to other products in this price range. After my daily rides on normal roads, it's held up quite well and I expect it will continue to do so for a good while.In summary, the product does exactly what it says it will, and is an excellent purchase for navigating your commute to and from work, or just zipping around town.

After feeding that set to the “helpful hardware guy” that recommended it to me, I went to my go-to hardware store, Amazon. Unfortunately I didn’t take the time to read the reviews on the set I was attracted to (it was shiny & neon green, so it captivated me in my full-on ADHD mode) & that it SAID the bits were hardened steel, I bought it.

Some of these are your typical penny giveaways, but the magnetic bit driver, suction cup and tweezers are QUALITY. I previously used a pair of cheap, clunky plastic tweezers that made trying to grab small objects and objects at an angle a PAIN. These tweezers are a major upgrade -- the ultra-sharp fingers & strong steel construction make it much easier to manipulate ribbon cables and such with precision. The suction cup is also not your average -- it is larger, stronger, and has an actual solid handle for better leverage, as opposed to the standard cheap ones with a keyring.

Still love them!I have two of these and am planning to buy a 3rd. I have 3 cats and 3 feeders will reduce fighting or getting left out of food times. Now onto the feeder...I love this thing. It is great quality and looks nice. I have had previous electronic feeders that were not user-friendly, and this one is a breath of fresh air. Plus their amazon profile has a US-based customer care number. Luckily I have not had to call, but still nice to have.My two biggest complaints:(These have happened on BOTH units I own, so I know it's not just that I had a dud or something)1. When you record the audio for your feeding time, you have to use the microphone on the unit. Why can't I just record it using my phone? Since I have to use the unit, and the mic is not good, I basically have to scream to get a normal volume recording. If I talk in my normal voice, it barely picks anything up. Good news is once you have recorded the audio, you are good. One and done.2. You NEED to buy 3 D cell batteries to keep in the unit. If it loses wifi for any reason, it will not connect back up. In my case, it was due to a power outage. Nothing I did connected it back up. This happened twice and I ended up deleting and re-adding the feeder from square 1. This is mildly frustrating, but it goes deeper... I deleted and re-added the feeder. Since I was setting up everything from scratch I decided to change the food times a little bit. While the app only showed the new food times, the unit REMEMBERS the old food times. For instance pre-power-outage I was feeding the cats at 5am. When I set it back up, the first feeding time was 8am. But they were still being fed, with audio and everything at 5am AND 8am!! To fix this I had to make a 5am feeding time in my app, disable it and then delete it. However, you should not have this problem if you just put D batteries so it can maintain power and you will be saved the headache!So to summarize - this unit does have a few quirks but it is still the best feeder available for this price range.\n","id":"8a90cef7-887b-47b8-8da7-fffd7f9b5f75"},{"text":"\n  I waited after using one month to leave the review, I love this product!!!

(Soo...if the 5mp that they want to send me ends up working, that still will not tell me whether the 8mp worked!)  Confused.  Let's wait and see.##UPDATE 3 !  DEPSTECH DID in fact send me a working 5MP endoscope, FREE of charge That was very nice of them.  Ok, so my guess is that the original 8MP endoscope was a defect.  The 5MP endoscopes do work.  Will I ever know whether or not the 8MP endoscopes work?  Let's wait and see!\n","id":"040eee68-fb03-4f80-a303-5842af45231b"},{"text":"\n  Amazing 8MP picture/video quality. Button placement requires memorizing, but easy to use this endoscope after 5-10 minutes of playing with it. App is great and easy to use. Taking images, video, and finding the files for playback is simple. Connecting my phone to app was easy and only took a couple of minutes the first time around--the quick guide included helped. First impression after opening box was, \"the camera is HUGE!\" Like it's stated in the ad, it is just over a half inch wide...I repeat...just over a HALF INCH WIDE (lol)--take that into consideration, if you're wanting to use this in very small spaces and in spark plug holes. Image quality is truly phenomenal. The variable zoom really helps and worked like a charm...it doesn't diminish the picture quality like usual digital zooms. The autofocus is absolutely fantastic. I've since bought the Depstech 5.0MP endoscope with the same handle and features, but I'm really missing the auto-focus of this 8.0MP unit. I did notice some camera lag at times when viewing live feed, but that may be because my Galaxy s10+ phone memory is super low. The cable can be pulled out of the grip and has a USB plug so it can be used with a PC--thats a really nice option. Four levels of camera light brightness is quite helpful, but there are times (such as when working in larger areas) when that's just not enough and alternative lighting is needed. The front of the camera has a collar that unscrews--you can then screw on one of the three included handy tools (mirror, hook, or magnet). The tools are built strong and aren't flimsy like other manufacturer endoscope tools. The neodymium magnetic tip was thoughtfully engineered circular to go around the camera so as not to interfere with visibility and it is strong and capable of \"holding on\" to a lot of weight. Manufacturer included colored protective film over the mirror to help buyers realize that it needs to be removed prior to using it (I've read a few reviews where buyers complained about the mirrors being cheap and trash, but they'd simply failed to remove the protective film and that was the real issue). Very happy with purchase--I just wish the width of the camera housing was a bit skinnier to enable me to use it in tiny particular areas where I'd love to use it (such as checking inside spark plug holes). The 8.0MP and overall quality of this unit is pretty awesome.\n","id":"3d81f4de-a50f-4fb4-a671-ff40c227db7e"},{"text":"\n  I have several endoscopes and this is my new favorite for applications that do not require a small camera to sneak into a a small hole like a spark plug thread.  The offsetting benefit is really good optics and an auto-focusing camera.  This is a first in my experience and really handy combined with the already very good depth of field and angle of view.Also, an issue with previous versions has been remedied on this one.  That is the processing lag in image rendering when moving the camera at all but very slow speeds.  This one now keeps up with the actual movement of the camera.Some minor criticisms:  The lighting adjustment is a 3 step push-button affair.  It's fine, but I really prefer the rheostat/dial on some of their other models.  Also, the button for the flashlight on the unit is too close to the LED adjustment for the camera, so is easy to push by accident.Build quality is very high and battery life is longer than you will ever need.  I don't know exactly how long, but I would guess well over 2-3 hours.  On a side note, this is the first one I've used that has a detachable camera probe.  It connects to the main unit via USB and I found I could connect it to my laptop and use the camera with my Smart Camera app.  You won't have LEDs (at least I didn't) but image quality is very good in this mode also.\n","id":"12f85821-7304-4825-9a05-0f04c1be94ec"},{"text":"\n  I was worried about getting a running belt w/ the water bottles but needed something for my long training runs and don't like to have anything in my hands.

The bottle did not  bounce around and was completely filled and the belt stayed in place without riding up or rotating around, and that was laying against a slippery moisture wicking shirt. I will advise though, to get the best fit, just re-thread the belt going through the INSIDE direction of the clasps so that the excess lays against your body and under the belt, not outside flapping in the breeze. Mine came in the package so the excess belt hangs loose on the outside, I immediately recognized I wouldn't like that so just completely un-threaded both sides and re-threaded.\n","id":"1efa37b2-e39a-4305-9920-46e57390d7a2"},{"text":"\n  My original review was not favorable.

It has rechargeable batteries and they seem to last a very long time additionally the app shows battery level at start-up.Using BACtrack is easy, first, you must wait 15 minutes from the time of your last drink or your readings will be artificially high.  Once you are past the 15 minutes just hold the on/off button down until it lights up, open the app wait a few seconds and tap the screen once \"BAC test\" pops up.  The unit warms up then asks you to blow (also a light on the hand held will flash), it might take a few tries to get used to it but once you do it is very easy.  Wait a few more seconds and your BAC is displayed.  It's \"time to sober\" is interesting, for me it is usually off by some margin.My only complaint is it has a \"need a ride\" button that opens your uber app, although it is buried in the settings menu for some reason if a person blows over or even at .06 I wish it would pop up on the results page.Even on nights when I wasn't drinking I've had several friends blow and end up taking uber or waiting the 20-30 minutes to get to the legal limit.Overall this thing is great.  The design of the unit and the app are very simple and well done.  When potentially dealing with impaired people simple is important.  I like knowing what my limits are and knowing when I go past them helps ensure I make the correct choice to drive or get uber.\n","id":"cc16120d-46ad-4b0e-9ad2-c6083cd43e63"},{"text":"\n  This has actually changed my life. I drink way less, now that I know how off my idea of “drunk” compares to reality. The app asks you to guess your BAC before you blow, so you’re almost forced to compare reality to your perception.

Below are listed pros and consCons:1. unless you have the ball/socket locknut completely tight, the socket will freely and easily pull off of the ball mount.2. Although I ordered the metal handle bar mount, the socket side that your phone mounts to, it’s all made of plastic.3. On thicker handle bars, you have to remove the rubber padding or it will not fit around the handle bars4. I have an iPhone XS Max but bigger phones MAY not fit, but probably will.Pros:1. Adjustable. With the ball and socket style mount, even with sun glare you can find a sweet spot to get the glare off the screen2. Price3. Ease of installation4. Phone quickly attaches and detaches.If you’re reading these reviews and you’re a little worried about ordering the product because you saw where some people said that their phone went flying off of the handle bars, know this: When I first mounted it, yes, the ball and socket would easily pull apart and did give me a false sense of security but you HAVE to get it tight so the socket properly grips the ball mount. If you think it’s tight, it’s probably not tight enough. You’ll know it’s tight enough when you can grip the phone mount and pull with a lot of force and it doesn’t pop loose. I give mine a “test tug” everyday before I mount my phone and ever since I got it tight, it’s been flawless ever since.With that being said, that’s why i gave the mount a 4 star review on the security features. Someone who doesn’t know any better might think it’s tight enough and it just isn’t, next thing they know their phone is lost somewhere on the interstate and broken.Make sure you order the metal mount\n","id":"c6b4d362-18e0-42de-83cc-b5fa5bdae164"},{"text":"\n  Like I said in the headline if you're expecting RAM mount quality you're going to be very disappointed.

This book was bought in a time of emergency after finding out that a child had been hiding things from us on her phone and us realizing that we had completely lost control of the phone use and not taken a more involved strategy when we just handed a kid a computer that had access to all the good and bad things in the world.  After reading it we felt more empowered to take back control of our kid's electronic lives and to start having healthy conversations with them about the topic.  This topic, I believe, will be the single most important topic for quite some time when it comes to parenting and society as as a whole.  This book really walks along side you when it comes to taking back control of your families tech use.  I really liked the parts on keeping a lifelong conversation open with the kids and the practical side of using Apple ScreenTime for control.  The world has changed in the past 10yrs and we as parents NEED to adapt our tactics and get up to speed on how our kid's generation communicates and thinks.  I'd encourage you to also take advantage of the other Axis resources from their website, they are great tools to equip us parents in the struggle of connecting to our kids.Parents... you can DO this!  Don't be afraid of your kids hating you, they already dislike you anyway, and the tactics detailed in this book will help you end the insanity that tech can bring.\n","id":"fbc80159-0185-472a-a9a0-90df4998dc4c"},{"text":"\n  As a licensed psychologist, I highly recommend Smartphone Sanity.

It barely holds onto the commuter otter box cases I use.2. There's no way to charge the controller and use this at the same time, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't a pain getting the clamp on and off. The little tabs hold the mount onto the controller are tiny and feel like they're wear down and break.3. I dropped it with the controller attached once, and 2 of the 3 hooks broke off.

My biggest gripe is that it takes some finessing to get attached. I guess I'll just have to get used to that. And then there's my minor gripe. I don't like that they didn't make a third color to match the SNES styled controller. The Gameboy grey and SNES grey don't clash too badly, but it still bugs me a bit. Somewhere in the middle is the build quality. The extension portion of the clip is a little flimsy. It's plastic isn't amazing but not terrible.

Since installing there has been one firmware update. That update caused the app to tell the lock that it was facing the other direction. This meant that the lock would \"jam.\" I thought the lock was failing and it took me a bit to figure it out.2. This isn't the fault of the lock, but towards the end of the day when the sun is setting and beating down on my front door the fingerprint sensor doesn't work. Not a huge deal, because of the other ways to unlock it. Just something you should know if you're looking to buy.3. I had a locksmith come to rekey all of my locks down to a single key after I moved into a new house. I read that this uses a Schlage key, so I swapped all my other locks to Schlage. The locksmith went to rekey only to discover that while the key body for this lock is a Schlage the teeth are cut as Kwikset. Not the end of the world. I just have two keys instead of one, but make sure you buy Kwikset locks if you want it compatible with this one.Like I said up above, overall I am really satisfied with this lock. I did a lot of research on smart locks prior to purchasing and I am glad I took a shot with this one.\n","id":"3b320936-4f56-4341-a636-15e4834f38ad"},{"text":"\n  No matter how many times I place a tissue box on the car seat, somehow it ends up on the floor and invariably gets crushed, with tissues spilling out and basically unusable.

It has a spot for you to access the buttons, but it is made well enough that you are not worried about accidentally pressing any of them.The main reason I like this is that it means that I can just give the kids the relay and let them go.

The sound quality isn’t always great but that could be user error considering my kids are kind of young. In order for it to work, your app has to be open on your phone otherwise you just get an alert that says “relay is trying to communicate with you” and your kid just gets “nobody in your group is online” and the messages are never recorded so you have to ask what they said.

At first, it worked very well, fast charging, sturdy cable, solid connections to charger and phone. Unfortunately, after 3-4 months of daily gentle use (never tugged/pulled/dropped/etc), it stopped charging - the micro USB connector would not maintain a proper connection (wiggling it helped a few times). Visually, the metal part looked bend. There is no other visible damage to the cable. Tested it on other devices, same issue. Then I started using the other cable, now 3-4 months later, the EXACT same issue happened.Fortunately Anker offers a 18-month warranty on these cables (hence the 3-star overall rating, otherwise I'd given 1-star). The process is very simple - I filled out an online form (need purchase proof and pic of cables), got an auto email confirming details, then got an agent email the next morning saying replacement cables are on their way. Although, shipping time quoted was 7-10 business days due to current supply chain disruptions.*note - I've used countless USB->micro USB charging cables, OEM or mass market, from $1 a piece to $15 a piece. In my experience, every single time the micro USB connector got bend up and stopped charging, way before any other parts of the cable getting worn out. I'd say buy from a vendor that offers great replacement policy, since none of the cables is reliable on quality.\n","id":"1e596e5f-43d0-457b-85e2-59e328344d52"},{"text":"\n  Don't buy cheap cables from store or gas station!

It hasn't caused any charging issues yet but for the word heavy duty I'd expect this kinda bend months down the line not weeks.

They are never folded up and transported, but instead lie against the floor or table plugged into a charger that we don't move around.

However...  with that said, the sound quality is amazing.  Plugged into my stereo, these were amazing.  But... and here’s the kicker... they don’t work with a PS4.  For $205 (taxes and whatnot), they didn’t include a usb converter to connect, let alone the 3.5mm plugged into the controller that won’t recognize the microphone.  My goal when shopping was comfort and sound, but comfort being first and these were comfortable.  Again, the sound is amazing... if you’re a musician and need a quality pair of studio headphones, these are for you.  If you’re a gamer and rocking that Sony vibe, take a pass.  After spending $2 to ship them back, I went to Best Buy and got a $100 set of HyperX Cloud 2’s.  Sound isn’t as good, but at least I can chat while playing.Just a note, the microphone itself is a secondary product from another company that gets plugged into a splitter and is attached using adhesive to the side.

I purchased it in July 2020 and it broke after 6 uses on the grill in early September 2020. It's been sitting in a drawer since.The app is fairly easy to use and does offer insight on how long it will take to cook at the current rate. The bluetooth range is also decent if you have good line of sight between your mobile device and the body of the thermometer. It will disconnect if you walk too far or have a large obstacle between your phone and the thermometer. Reconnecting isn't always automatic and you may need to restart the app and restart tracking a cooking session.The probe however has gone completely kaput after just 6 times on the grill at medium temperature. It no longer registers temperature correctly and it's stuck at 572F both for the sensor in the bottom of the probe that goes into food, and the top of the probe that measures the ambient temperature in the grill or in the oven. If you twist the probe a bit temperature fluctuates for a second and then returns to 572F. The probe is obviously done and this is highly disappointing.Otherwise the device seems to function fine. I just need a replacement probe and I will not be able to leave it on the grill over the risk of destroying another probe so it becomes completely useless for the use it was intended for. The idea behind this product is that it stays inside the meat or other food you're trying to cook, in order to estimate how long it will take to cook it the desired internal temperature. If I have to use it as an instant thermometer it's more of a nuisance than anything else and any standard digital stick thermometer will do a faster and better job at giving me an instant reading.I'm way past return window with Amazon so I will be taking this up with the manufacturer to see if I can at least get a replacement probe. I'm highly disappointed that this probe failed after so few uses. Maybe I'll get one of their standard thermometers next and ditch this \"smart\" unit that either has quality control issues with the probes, or is simply a dud.Not recommended at all. You're very much better off with an instant read thermometer and monitoring what you're cooking frequently instead of relying on this. I only lost 1 large tri tip to it + the purchase price of this Carbon Lite unit so all in all I'm out about $60.\n","id":"aa2f3b82-0754-4355-96ea-c306b0062725"},{"text":"\n  My husband loves this!

He especially liked the fact that it turns red, yellow or green, depending on how far along it is in the cooking process, and the fact that it not only measures the temp of the meat but the temp of the inside of the smoker/BBQ. For the price, it's excellent. -One thing, it's geared towards Apple (shocker) so according to the reviews, sometimes Android users have issues connecting to it.

Even in my backyard with direct line of sight i lose connectivity around 40-50 feet away.4) The app is OK, but you always need to have phone in hand to check temp.Short story long, the product is OK, but I think a digital temp probe is the way to go.\n","id":"77dfffc6-fa31-4086-a6dc-0615c9a52704"},{"text":"\n  Hooked up easily to my Samsung Note 10.

Very good shock resistance and toughness are also key properties of this alloy in the heat treated condition.\" I'm still amazed at the machining quality of the bits.Here is a list of applications I'm aware of for some of the special bits you won't find in other kits:5.5mm Nut Driver - Printer and copier repairSpanner/Snake-eye bits - Security panels, elevators, bathroom hardware.Square/Robertson bits - Common in Canada/AustraliaJIS /Japanese Industrial Standard - Used in cameras, remote control helicopters, drones and other electronics.Torx Security.

I had a bear of a time with the removal of the two P000 M1.4 x 3.2mm screws from an old HP ElitePad. Very sad to report that the P000 from what I thought was a crap set from Harbor Freight actually got the screws out where the iFixit driver and bits failed. Once that painful and embarrassing experience was over the usefulness of the iFixit kit started to show itself with the tray for holding the screws including the six inside that hold down the battery, the spudgers and blue pry tools for getting the case open (the suction cup sort of worked but is crap so fail for that piece as well), the driver which is very smooth and fits very well for delicate and precise hand held work and the tweezers for grabbing dropped screws. I do like the way the foam holds the bits. Very clean and organized and easy to get and out back. Would love P000 and P00 to each be 3mm longer and for #2 Triangle bit to be 5mm longer. The folks machining the bit could easily do this with the existing bits as there is plenty of steel hanging out of the holder than could be machined down to the OD of the working end of the bit without affecting the way the driver holds the bits at all.\n","id":"fdbb16a8-f367-498e-ae0b-cc06fa2704c9"},{"text":"\n  I've used a lot of toolkits out there, but none haven't I found that are as versatile and useful as this one. This toolkit can enable you to open up almost any device out there, but what's better is they also offer device repair teardown videos and detailed instructions with the very tools this kit comes with, so you don't have to wing it and potentially break the device you intend to repair.As for the quality of the tools, this is by far the best out there. The driver piece is straight aluminum painted black with a really nice blue aluminum cap that twists so smoothly, like it's using ball bearings. The tip also has a really solid magnet built in so any tiny bolt wont fall off of the driver, which is super nice because I've spent way too much time searching for really tiny dropped bolts that are sometimes smaller than ants. This uses almost every driver bit and special tool you'll need to safely disassemble your devices. Also the cap of the driver set also has a raised internal grid to separate and store your bolts while you're working on a device.I love iFixit a lot and I highly recommend this product, however the reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because the case's velcro strips almost don't line up at all, which means it's really difficult to close and usually doesn't stay closed.\n","id":"162ce912-9f2d-4f46-9bd6-1beccfc0ec28"},{"text":"\n  I bought an iFixit tool kit stand alone a while back.

Below are listed pros and consCons:1. unless you have the ball/socket locknut completely tight, the socket will freely and easily pull off of the ball mount.2. Although I ordered the metal handle bar mount, the socket side that your phone mounts to, it’s all made of plastic.3. On thicker handle bars, you have to remove the rubber padding or it will not fit around the handle bars4. I have an iPhone XS Max but bigger phones MAY not fit, but probably will.Pros:1. Adjustable. With the ball and socket style mount, even with sun glare you can find a sweet spot to get the glare off the screen2. Price3. Ease of installation4. Phone quickly attaches and detaches.If you’re reading these reviews and you’re a little worried about ordering the product because you saw where some people said that their phone went flying off of the handle bars, know this: When I first mounted it, yes, the ball and socket would easily pull apart and did give me a false sense of security but you HAVE to get it tight so the socket properly grips the ball mount. If you think it’s tight, it’s probably not tight enough. You’ll know it’s tight enough when you can grip the phone mount and pull with a lot of force and it doesn’t pop loose. I give mine a “test tug” everyday before I mount my phone and ever since I got it tight, it’s been flawless ever since.With that being said, that’s why i gave the mount a 4 star review on the security features. Someone who doesn’t know any better might think it’s tight enough and it just isn’t, next thing they know their phone is lost somewhere on the interstate and broken.Make sure you order the metal mount\n","id":"343fee5b-f75e-4e66-ad7f-15f7a4d5044d"},{"text":"\n  Like I said in the headline if you're expecting RAM mount quality you're going to be very disappointed.

The price is very reasonable compared to the brand names, it looks sharp, and it's simple to operate. Open the app, hop on the scale (no buttons to hit or pre-calibration to wait for), and in about 5 seconds it's connected to your phone and has measured your weight and bio impedance measurements.  The scale measured within 0.5lbs of my previous scale, so it seems accurate enough.  The app logs your measurements over time and gives you a nice trend of all of it's stats, as well as showing you where you fit compared to 'ideal' ranges for things like BMI, weight, body fat %, etc.  I really like the idea of it being rechargeable, but it's only been two weeks and I haven't had to charge it yet.  I'll update my review if anything unusual happens (short battery life, or wont charge).The app was easy to install, and required next to zero setup.  On Android it only asked for reasonable permissions.  I was worried that it was going to be one of those apps that wanted my contact list, access to my microphone, and my firstborn child, but it seems benign.  It also was simple to connect it to Fitbit (my reason for buying this scale), and now I have a better picture of my total fitness all in one place.All in all, I'm very happy with this scale.  It's simple and easy, yet does all of the fancy things you'd expect from a smart scale, and at a totally reasonable price.

My first one was very helpful and has lasted me over a year of stepping on and off without any signs of usage. It still looks like new. The only reason I bought this was for the reason that it is rechargeable. And this scale works like a charm and connects to the app via Bluetooth readily. What's new,- Rechargeable scale that connects to a power source via microUSB. The scale maintains very good charge. It has been a week since my 1-hour charge and it still holds power.- New improved design than my old scale. Looks more appealing.- The letters are legible and clear to read.The scale measures your physical body weight, BMI, body fat%, water %, skeletal muscle, fat-free body weight, muscle mass, bone mass, protein, basal metabolism, and body age. I primarily look at my physical weight and body fat %. The fat% seems fairly accurate to what I would expect it to be. So this is an easy way to measure body fat instead of spending money for a number that would be at best 2% off from what this scale measures.The app connectivity is very easy and straightforward. There is a manual that clearly lays out the steps to connect to the app. And even without that it's easy if we follow the app. Looking up the scale took a minute and the scale automatically connects via Bluetooth to the phone to record the data.If i want to be picky, the only gripe I may have is that it doesn't come in white. The black colour is still very pleasing to the eye.

I didn't have a WPS enabled router, so I basically hooked up the bridge to AC power (a USB power cable is also supplied if you want to directly power the bridge via USB on your computer/device), used another computer's Wi-Fi to connect directly to the bridge, accessed the setup page on a web browser, entered my router's SSID and password, then a few minutes later the bridge was up and running giving internet access to all my Ethernet-based devices! So far, the signal and speed on the bridge is excellent and I'm not getting any dropouts or lags. I can't say the same to a similar cheaper Chinese device called the Vonet VAP11G, which was a nightmare to setup and could not get a steady internet connection at all. If you're looking for a bridge that's dead simple to set up and get running, this one is your choice!About the only con I can think of are that the Ethernet cable they supplied with you is pathetically short, like less than 1ft.

However, I marked it to three stars due to the experiences I had:- It was somewhat difficult to set up.  Disclaimer- I used a Mac.  The auto setup file that you can run by connecting to it wirelessly may work great on a windows machine and the auto find may also work great if your router supports that.  However I had to do it the \"old fashioned\" way through a wires Ethernet connection.  The Mac took a fee tries to see the bridge and then I had to tell it to connect to the router six times before it actually connected.  No errors in my inputs, it would see the router, start connecting and then just fail.  Finally took and worked fine though.- Other major issue: I lost power to it for an unknown amount of time while out of town and when I came back it wasn't connecting to my router.  Plugged into it and all the settings were correct, it just couldn't obtain an IP address.  Tried a number of different things but eventually had to reset the bridge.

This Disney set with Mickey and friends are always hot with my preschoolers as the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is huge here. We have lots of books we read about them so this was a no brainier. The gist is, you download an app called Moonlite onto your phone. Put in the access code you got in the box of slides you've purchased and then hook up the projector to your phone. Choose your book from the list, match up the slide, pop it in and your off. Pretty simple right?The good: The kids love watching the slide on the wall/ceiling/my pants leg, wherever you choose to project it on, in full color. As I read the story, there are circled words that coordinate with the character's actions that have sound effects. If Pluto jumps in the lake, you hear a splash. If your children are busy talking and miss it, you can push it again and again until they stop talking and hear it. :) The slides advance with the story to help keep interest and they really seem to enjoy it. It's a great bedtime story as you do this in the dark so everyone settles down. It's possible to see this in a dimmer room during the day, but not great.The meh: I'm usually an easy going person so not much annoys me, this did however. To start with, it's a small pain to get it just lined up with your phone's light even with the bullseye they provide you. After you've done that, you're golden until it's time to flip the slide. This is the most annoying part. You manually turn the wheel so the next slide clicks in place but more than half the time, it also moves the positioning of the projector lens over the flash light. It takes minimal effort to fix but after doing it so many times, gets monotonous and interrupts the story. It's just not enough of a smooth movement to advance the slide by inserting your fingernail into the notch and flipping it. The stories are somewhat limited in length as there are only so many slides per wheel. Most of the Mickey mouse books are generally shorter anyway. I'll use this occasionally as the kids like it but, it's really a bit of effort to get it set up. I may just be lazy but I'm tired at the end of the day.\n","id":"46ccb79a-12ad-4df5-ae7f-9db2c4f7f68e"},{"text":"\n   We absolutely love Moonlite and have gathered around 10 reels to read with our boys before bedtime.

I will say, these stories in particular are a bit better suited for a younger audience, for ages 1-3. They're fairly simple and straightforward, and a little too baby-ish for my Pre-K aged boy. He still listens to them just fine, but I think they're better suited for his little brother.

Relying on cell phone flash lights to project pictures on the wall is probably not the best idea. It would have been better if they developed something that came with a flash light. The Mickey Mouse stories that come with this are fun but I cannot recommend this to parents. See my list of pros / cons below.Pros:- Usually in every paragraph there's a word circled on the app. You can press this word and it'll make sound effects that are related to that word. Makes the reading more fun for the kids and creates a nice storytelling environment for the book- With all its flaws, my kids do like this device a lot.Cons:- Every time I change slides, it maligns the projector. Maybe this wouldn't happen if I didn't have a case on my phone. I am constantly readjust the projector so I can get a good image--pretty annoying- Blurry picture, comes with a focusing lens but the picture is never as sharp as you'd like it to be.- You need to register for an account to use this. It's free to download the app and register the account as long as you have your activation code that comes in the box. Don't expect to sell this to another person as they won't be able to get access to the stories on the app because you've already used the activation code.- Within the app, there were a few situations where a button I wanted to press was behind the projector clip.

The older cable became unusable after the prongs on the MicroUSB end became stuck inside their housing and would no longer keep the cable attached to my phone.I know two data points does not indicate a trend, but the old cable lasted roughly 10 months, and this cable also lasted roughly 10 months. The failure of this cable spurred me to write this review.Note: My phone is a Motorola Moto X (2nd Generation).Pros:• The cable charged my phone quickly (but it no longer does, so that's a bummer).Cons:• The cable has stopped working after 10 months. I think the problem is not in the \"cable\" per se, but in one of the connectors on the ends of the cable, specifically, the MicroUSB end. About a week before the cable stopped working completely, I could sort of charge my phone, but only if I \"correctly\" oriented the cable in relation to the MicroUSB end—if the cable protruded straight down, my phone would not charge, but if the cable deviated to the left or to the right, it would charge. To complicate things, the \"correct\" angle of orientation would change periodically and randomly.Based on my experience with these cables, I have concluded that rating the cable to withstand a certain number of bends is irrelevant. Problems always occur in the connectors, not the cable itself. Does anyone have any advice for how to avoid such problems, or any suggestions for charging cables that don't suffer from such problems?Six-Week Update (03.12.2017):• Because I have already owned this cable for 10 months, and because the cord is now broken, I will not provide a six-week update as I usually do.\n","id":"30d5717c-5b67-4689-a15a-36781198f354"},{"text":"\n  I have now had a number of Anker micro USB charging cords for our phones - probably over 10.  Anker definitely has a defect in either its design or manufacturing.  In most of the cords, including the most recent purchase less than a month ago, after a number of weeks or months (certainly not years), the cable no longer stays in the device when moved whatsoever.  It falls out or at least doesn't connect well enough to charge.  Most of the times we have been able to move the connector a little until it charges, but if we touch the cable or device whatsoever, it will stop charging.  This time, after only 2-3 weeks, we can't even do that.  We simply cannot get it to recognize the charger at all.I agree with what \"mitchdunc\" said in his/her review on November 20, 2015:The cable is well built. What isn't well built is the connector that goes into your device. About a month after using this cable, the pins remain retracted inside the cable. This causes the cable to not stay in the device when it's moved. The cable simply falls out.This has been a recurring problem for us, over and over, and can't be isolated to us.  It wasn't just one or two bad cables.  Besides the connector, it is a good cable, but that doesn't matter.  I can't continue to afford the time required to return the cables either to Amazon before one month or to Anker.  Anker does have a good replacement guarantee and customer service.

The cord is a decent length, not too long and not too short, and the clip is really tight. I struggled to get the clip to open the first time, but I actually really like that, because it means it won't fall off my shirt.

So, don't be afraid to get this just because you have a newer iPhone without a headphone jack :)\n","id":"5878ee72-f6fb-4bc3-86b8-0810dd4ed702"},{"text":"\n   This little inexpensive mic does exactly what I need it to do: Record better quality sound than my iPhone 6S Plus.

With this controller all settings are made through an app via a bluebooth connection (which has to be established every time you want to change settings on the controller).Installation and configuring through the app went well, easier then I thought. So far after 2 weeks of running 3 seperate controllers daily, it works as expected.The biggest design flaw of this controller, which I didn't realize when buying/installing, is that you cannot turn on the valve without connecting the controller in the app first. There is no seperate physical knob or handle on the controller to just turn on that water regardless of settings (or at least I didn't find it yet). I don't have a gardener, but if I had one, this person would need me to turn the water on with my smartphone or install the app on it's own phone. That's pretty inconvenient.For now for me, this flaw weighs less then the convenience I'm experiencing of just having a wireless simplified device to water my lawn .

Even basic recipes I manage to ruin the meat.  So I gave up and ate out almost every meal.  This was unhealthy and I gained a LOT! of weight and have high blood pressure.  When I saw the original Meater, I was intrigued with the idea of something automating cooking steaks in particular.  I bought the original Meater about 5 months ago and it really did change my life.  I still eat out, but only 2-3 times per week.  I have lost weight, have more energy, and blood pressure went down.  All in 5 months.  Even if you don't buy a Meater, just stop eating out and it helps.A few days ago, I saw this new Meater+ that now has a built in extender in the charger.  I received it 2 days ago and have made Ribeye and Tri-tip already.  It works great.With Meater (original one) I used an old iPhone next to Weber BBQ that would connect probe to Wifi.  Then I used my iPhone to connect to probe anyway in the house.  I have an access point in my house and could stay connected down the street.  With Meater+, no iPad is needed now.  The wood charger now extends the Bluetooth signal from probe.  How it works is you just leave the charger next to BBQ and it extends the signal really far.  I didn't measure the exact distance but my BBQ is in the back yard and my office is on the other side of the house upstairs.  Connected perfectly and I answered emails while my steak was cooking.  When alarm went off, I went back downstairs and had a perfect ribeye!  Even tells you how long to let it sit before you cut it up.Couple tips-  I updated the original Meater app on my iPhone and make sure you do the initial charge for 4 hours.  I was so anxious that I tried connecting probe to iPhone out of box and it wouldn't connect.  I thought it was defective.

Mountains behind our house are about 4 miles away and I wanted something that could dial in a little better for observing wildlife and decided on this Gosky 2019 model.  I'm impressed.  The Gosky is better in almost every way except size, where it's about double the size of the Roxant.The Roxant is great for it's mobility, something you could grab and sit on the hood of a car while site seeing.  This Gosky is a bit larger, but, the performance is pretty darn good.  It's ability to focus on distant objects is significantly better than the Roxant.  The focus wheel on the Gosky is also easier to use.  One thing I did notice on the Gosky is that zooming in/out on any object always requires refocusing as well (not so much on the Roxant).  But the ease of focusing makes this a minor issue.As others have pointed out, the tripod is not the greatest.  However, it serves my needs just fine.  By the way, the tripod that comes with both the Gosky and Roxant are nearly identical.I like the Roxant for its size and it is convenient for shorter distances (several hundred yards or less).  However, the Gosky for my purpose (generally sitting in my backyard with the scope sitting on a table) is now my go-to scope.  The clarity and focus at long distances sets it apart.Comparing these two models is like comparing apples to oranges.  I only compare the two since these are the only two I have experience with and may help someone else with a decision.  The Roxant is about $80 while the Gosky is about $140.  The specs are obviously different as well with the Roxant spec'd at 12-36x50 while the Gosky spec's at 20-60x80. If your distance is within a few hundred yards, save your money and go with the Roxant.  If you're looking for a scope that can focus really well at long distances, then you may want to consider the Gosky (or a competitor that has similar specs).I see some scopes that are 15 times the cost of this Gosky with similar specs and I wonder what those scopes provide that this Gosky doesn't (perhaps a better tripod, night vision?).  If someone experienced with spotting scopes can shed some light on how the significantly more expensive models compare, that would be helpful.\n","id":"2eeda7bd-86ab-4e71-8dea-b8b194de3938"},{"text":"\n  Quality and view is great.

I was very impressed with how easy it was to set up and use. The vertical pieces slide horizontally so that it can be adjusted for portrait or landscape mode. The phone fits in snugly (so it's safe) yet I can easy remove the phone from the holder when I'm ready to exit the car. I have a Galaxy S8 but I think any phone would fit because the rubbery material is firm and flexible and should accommodate lots of different sized phones.I was a little concerned about the adhesive. Would it be too strong and leave a residue? Would it be too weak and allow the holder the slip? The good news is that neither of these is true. The holder sits firmly on the dashboard without slipping or sliding at all. At the same time, I can remove it by pulling up on the bottom rubbery piece and there is no residue at all on the dashboard. This is true even after the car has sat in the sun on a hot July day!I really like using this when I'm navigating to a destination with the phone.

There's a maliciousness to the way that social media and networked technologies are meant to engage users and then keep them hooked. This book could have and should have been built around really striking that chord entirely through relevant research on how corporations like Facebook, Google, Instagram, etc are doing this, but instead it's mostly anecdotal, ie, each chapter is mostly comprised of stories about goals (ie, running marathons), feedback (ie, gambling), or progress (ie, Super Mario Brothers) to show how technological addiction can work in pieces. He then sprinkles in some more hard hitting facts about contemporary implementation from those corporations. If they're doing this, I don't need anecdotes to explain goal-orientation beyond a page or so to set it up: just get to the point and then hit it home. Since they are doing this, just make the points and elaborate on them instead of making them the background to a book about a time when someone found a game was addictive or the author thought so.The cell phone is the fastest and most widespread acquisition and deployment of a single technology in the history of humanity. In a matter of decades it went from high end status symbol to currently being owned and used by half of the adults in the entire world. A quarter of the world's population are active Facebook users. What the book takes issue with is increasingly vital. When there are folks like Nicholas Carr writing deeply researched and strongly built arguments about the consequences of the interface revolution, it makes this book of anecdotes pretty meaningless.

But, sadly, all of this builds towards a conclusion that never really comes to fruition. Namely, after pretty firmly establishing that we, in the modern world, are really fighting against some powerful and pernicious digital devices and platforms that are designed to foster behavioral addiction, the author utterly fails to indict anybody in the Tech community for having willfully painted us into this corner—not Mark Zuckerberg, not Steve Jobs, not the UX designers who invented features like pull to refresh who don't allow their children to use handheld devices anymore. Instead, he offers some flimsy suggestions for replacing behavioral addictions with better habits, and even then suggests that gamification could be a positive form of behavioral addiction.In short, there's some cool background information in this book, but don't look for anything deeper than that.\n","id":"3a47ff76-88a4-4fba-8654-cb754e33892a"},{"text":"\n  Purchased this projector to project sewing patterns onto my cutting mat.

This is not a biased review. I am an honest consumer. Here are my thoughts.First of all, i thought of buying a projector to be used at school since I'm a teacher. I looked for budget projectors but all of them say that they are not recommended for powerpoint presentation. I researched and i took a risk at this one. Since it's Covid19 pandemic time, i can also use this in my room with my family as movie time at night. I am totally satisfied with what i saw. I never had a projector before so i have no point of comparison with other projectors but i don't need to own one to feel satisfied. I am satisfied with quality. I moved back the projector a little farther about 8 feet from the wall to get a bigger picture and wow the quality was not compromised. It gave me around 5 feet of diagonal screen (just estimate). The room was dark when i used it then i turned on our room lamp to see how it will hold up in a semi-lit room. Well, it hold up pretty well. Still, the contrast is pretty and the quality.As of the sound, it was enough to fill the room. I attached my small bluetooth speaker using wired connection to see if the volume will improve. It didn't. I don't know maybe my Bluetooth speaker wasn't strong enough so i just removed it.Now i tried playing my powerpoint presentation to check if it is good enough for school. Well it is more than good enough. The texts weren't as perfect as a computer screen but clear enough to be read especially if the font is big. This will help me a lot in my classroom discussion and considering it is very light and portable i can easily bring it anywhere.As a bonus, i connected my Samsung S20 using smartview connection and it was spot on. I read in the reviews that u need like a firestick to watch netflix or hulu because of copyright reasons but i was able to play and watch movies in Netflix just by connecting my S20 using smartview. I don't need to buy any firestick or roku, etc. Amazing. I'm not sure if u can do that in Apple or Samsung of older models.You may not know me but what I gave u was my honest thoughts.

For outdoor installation like mine, its a real challenge. I replaced an older model Rainbird that was failing after 10 years.  Really wanted the WiFi capabilities as my wiring and pump is installed outside in a very inconvenient location and I hate getting wet simply turning it on or off.The Controller itself is VERY small inside, and the access ports for electrical and pump / zone wires are quite small as well.  It took well over an hour to get just the electrical \"knock out\" removed and wiring fitted, but the little box that is supposed to be an \"electrical junction box equivalent\" is so small that I could not install the top ring on the conduit connector.  VERY poor engineering, guess they assume you are simply stuffing plain 120 V wires in the hole and securing them outside the controller?Now the WiFI, or lack thereof.  I use a whole house mesh router and have on average about 50 MBPS at the controller.  It took multiple times to get it to recognize the system, kept going on and off.  Finally caught it long enough and installed as a HotSpot only.  Never could get the true WiFi to work after multiple attempts. But if I sit outside, within 25-30 ft, the HotSpot it seems to work OK.  The user interface and documentation, videos online, etc are just plain silly.  More marketing than how to actually make the app be useful and function. And I refuse to continue to waste more hours to get the WiFi to work, but from what I read on other reviews, just having the HotSpot may actually be safer and more secure as the app accesses all sorts of things on my phone that have no business being accessed, other than it does.Caveat Emptor for sure on this set up.UPDATE:- You can NOT turn controller on or off via app. That's the dial knob only. RB advises to change start times or days on each of your programs to prevent programs from running-For app to work they recommend leaving controller dial knob in Auto position-They told me some users will simply not create programs but rather use the manual watering feature for each zone and run it when they want to water.

I like to understand the differences between products, state of the art, etc., and generally be an informed buyer. I've also been in \"tech\" for more than 35 years, with roles from hands on through CIO and CTO, so I've got a lot of experience researching and choosing products, whether for one person or thousands.  In short: I tend to be a picky shopper. I researched the field here, and think I've found a winner.At this point in my career, I'm traveling weekly, and I'm meeting -- either in person or remote -- with numerous people each week. Conference calls are the norm, and may involve dozens of people, conference rooms with poor equipment, offices with dreadful 15 year old \"speakerphones\", hotel rooms, working from my home office, etc. One of the most frustrating experiences is trying to participate in a mission critical conference call when 1) I can barely hear or understand the folks at the other end, and 2) they can't hear and understand me unless I lean over a mic and raise my voice. Cell phone \"speakerphones\" may be acceptable in an emergency, but haven't proven adequate for routine use.I had recently research Bluetooth speakers for use primarily as audio / music listening speakers (for use, e.g., with Google Play Music from my phone). I researched and auditioned many: Bose, Cambridge, JBL, Shark, Amazon, Phillips, Anker, Jambox, etc. I narrowed it down to those with speakerphone capability, thinking I'd satisfy that need along with the media speaker requirement. After a LOT of research and live auditions, I settled on Nyne Bass, and couldn't be happier with it -- as a media speaker - truly amazing in all respects: sound is stunningly good - even outdoors, and both battery life and bluetooth handling are excellent. Unfortunately, it's only mediocre when turning a phone into a speakerphone, and often quite disappointing -- and I've tried out colleague's products like Jambox for the same purpose, and also found them disappointing. So -- I went on the hunt for a \"real\" business quality Bluetooth speakerphone.After much research, I homed in on Jabra, and the 510+ looked most promising after reading a LOT of reviews. Buying via Amazon Prime, I knew I had no risk, so I place the order -- and had the package on my desk about 36 hours later. Once again -- kudos to Amazon Prime and the vendors that work with Amazon in this program.The product is perfectly packaged, and beautifully made. It appears to be about 4.5\" in diameter, and about 1.25\" high when sitting flat on a desk or table. It is a gorgeous, professional grade piece of tech with excellent fit and finish and features. It comes with a neoprene zipper case, the USB cord wraps around the body and tucks into a groove that also holds the cable end in place. Incredibly well thought out and executed.This model can be connected to a phone or laptop via bluetooth, and to a laptop via USB cable. It doesn't come with its own charging brick, but the USB cable can charge from any standard 1A or higher brick. It takes a while for a full charge, but once charged, I can use it all day and into the night, and the charge is only partially depleted.Sound quality is absolutely spectacular for the purpose. I can place this on a table or desk in a room with a dozen people at distances from 3 ft to 15 ft or more, and they are all picked up and easily understand by people at the other end of the call. What comes out of the speaker is superb as well: I'm often on the receiving end of a conference call with two dozen people, all different sound environments and volume levels, and half a dozen international accents -- and this speaker yields clear audio rivaling $400 or $500 Polycom and Cisco equipment (no exaggeration). This is so good, in fact, that I've taken to turning it on when sitting in my office at my current client's site, and using it in favor of the brand new Cisco equipment installed there. It's a better experience.The controls around the perimeter are all touch controls -- no physical buttons to degrade, and they work perfectly. Power, answer / hang up, volume up/down, bluetooth (on/off/pair), mute, battery (to check battery charge level). There are a serious of LEDs around the perimeter of the speaker that are almost invisible when off, but light up as needed to indicate function, e.g., Bluetooth connected, power on, volume level and battery life (number of lights on out of ten around the perimeter), etc. Audio prompts walk you through pairing, connection status, etc -- and these can be turned on and off via preferences.The firmware is easily upgradeable via the USB cable and downloadable PC application. I haven't had need to use the app yet, but it provides deeper control over options and connection to services like Lync. This also provides support for soft phones: this \"510+ MS edition\" is optimized for Microsoft products like Lync -- the other 510+ is, I believe, aimed more at other soft phone products like Cisco.All in all: a beautifully designed, engineered and implemented product. Every now and then you trip across a gem that defines state of the art in its category - and I believe this qualifies. As you might guess, I'm delighted with this product.\n","id":"dfe9104e-a1bd-4e6a-ae90-2c6d6b60649e"},{"text":"\n  First the good: It's compact, lightweight, and the haptic buttons are responsive and intuitive. It is easy to set up, and it has a decent form factor (although it could stand to be a little larger).Now what you'll notice immediately upon first use: \"Is the sound quality really this bad?? And for this price???\" I think it's an absolute SHAM that the sound quality is so poor. I got this thinking it would be a slight upgrade to my Macbook Pro speakers (those things are tiny, right?) Boy was I wrong. The sounds is hollow, distant, and lacks ANY semblance of bass. You have to crank the volume all the way to the max to get a decent level of sound (which of course means you will never get \"loud\" sound). In fact, the speakers from my iPhone sound better. It is really unacceptable. I would expect this kind of sound out of a cheapo \"Amazon Basics\" model, but not from 130 dollar speaker.Its only saving grace is that it works decently well as a conference speaker (if you don't care at all about the sound).\n","id":"1582328d-106c-44ed-8c4e-72b0f533237d"},{"text":"\n  I ran into an issue with the speaker running when connected either USB or dongle to docking station.

Unfortunately, most wrist based optical sensors are wildly inaccurate during activity. So that leaves you with two options: Chest strap, or arm based optical sensor. Chest strap being the gold standard for accuracy, but incredibly uncomfortable. That's where optical arm based sensors come in. They fall into a happy medium of \"good enough\". They are accurate, reliable, and more comfortable than a chest strap. If you've done your research, you know there are basically three options for arm based sensors - Wahoo, Scosche, and Polar. I won't get into all the details (See DC Rainmaker for a good comparison between the three), but I will tell you why Polar is the right choice.The polar OH1+ comes with a \"goggle clip\". Meaning, if you're a triathlete, you can clip the HR monitor to your goggles while you swim and it will record your temporal pulse for accurate HR data. That in itself is a nice feature, but what polar doesn't mention, and perhaps more importantly, is that you can use the clip anywhere there is reliable pulsation and a flat area of skin. Enter the \"waist clip\".  I started to clip the monitor into my running shorts and cycling bibs and found that it will accurately record HR data from the femoral pulsation. Perhaps even better data than the arm (More stable, less light penetration, stronger pulsation etc). This means no arm band, no chest strap, just a small clip into my shorts which is secure and hidden. This takes comfort and accuracy to another level. For this reason alone, this is the only optical HR monitor to consider.\n","id":"a1876451-3892-4565-84a1-6875162a3c9d"},{"text":"\n  I mainly got this heart rate monitor for running and cycling. There are somethings that I like about it, but also somethings that I don't like/think potential buyers should know. I'll be bringing up another Polar product, the H10 which is a ECG-based chest strap monitor, for some comparisons.Pros:- Getting it on and off is fairly simple. That's probably one of the biggest upsides to this compared to the H10.- It's quite lenient on where you put it. Meaning, you don't need to place it on one specific part of you're arm. Anywhere on your forearm and bicep area works.- It connects fairly seamlessly. Once I got it setup on my phone, I just need to turn the OH1+ on and it connects automatically. Works fine with the Strava app and with my Wahoo Elemnt Bolt.- The charger is nice and easy to use. It's a small USB cradle that you just need to pop the OH1+ into.Cons:- There's only one button on the OH1+ and I find it quite difficult to press. You have to push it in quite a bit for it to respond and there have been points in which I thought I turned it off, but hadn't due to not pushing it in enough. I usually have to use my fingernail to get it to work.- It takes sometime for it to detect heart rate spikes. I think this is one of the main upsides to the H10, that being that it's ECG based while the OH1+ uses LEDs. This simply means that the H10 detects heart rate changes faster than the OH1+. For me, this isn't a major problem because I'm doing runs/bike rides over long periods of time and the few seconds of delay aren't major for what I do. But if you're someone that needs to quickest readings, then an ECG based monitor would be better suited.The only other thing I think one might want to note is that when it is on, the OH1+ has an LED that blinks intermittently no matter what. During the day, it's not super noticeable, while at night is can make you standout. You can decide if this is a good or bad thing.But overall, I'm happy with the product and would recommend it.\n","id":"b518d129-39b3-46db-b177-76e43564da42"},{"text":"\n  How many chargers do you need for your phone? If you answer more than one, this isn’t the HRM for you.

They really need to at least add a cable to it so it’s easier to keep track of.  After only a week of ownership, I’m now stuck with a useless waste of money until I manage to reach the top of the customer service list.Edit.

For resting heart rate, the Apple Watch is fine. And while cycling, I dislike wearing chest straps, because it's too cold to put on on a chilly morning, and it often feels like it is slipping. I bought the Polar OH1+ to use standalone (not paired to anything) while running, and to use paired to my Garmin Edge 510 while cycling.Notes: 1) Although the material indicates that it comes with a goggles clip for swimming, there are actually two of them of different sizes in the box. 2) There are 3 different apps you may need -- if you use it unpaired and upload the data to your phone, then you need Polar Beat on your phone and a Polar Flow account on their website; if you use it paired to a watch or cycling computer and upload the data to your phone, then you need Polar Flow on your phone; if you upload the data to your PC with their USB dongle, and not through your phone or watch, then you need a Polar Flow account on their website, and Polar FlowSync on your PC. 3) None of the apps tell you how much battery life remains -- you have to rely on the LED color and blinking pattern. 4) It doesn't pair with the Apple Watch.Although figuring out which apps I needed was a bit confusing, the Polar OH1+ is just so much more convenient to wear, works well and is just as accurate as chest straps (see https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/03/polar-oh1-plus-optical-hr-sensor-in-depth-review.html for a detailed review).\n","id":"960df1f0-2efc-4378-bbf0-ced6355a3cda"},{"text":"\n  A great review if you need a solid review and practice tests.

The microphone is very easy to use. It has three main slider to control 3 types of volume, one for your voice's volume, one for your voice's echo and another the music that you are playing.

Obviously this isn't a $1000+ range projector, but with a ~$150 price range that I paid, my family is satisfied for the quality it delivers.Being a 720p projector, it scale your media up or down for projection at 720p. Therefore, the picture isn't crystal clearest when projecting too big. It is ideal to projection size is around 120\" or less. The focus dial wouldn't allow you to focus bigger than that anyway.I mostly interface with the projector via HDMI and SD card. The smartphone mirroring function utilize Mirracast technologies... which is disabled by some phone manufacturer like Google Pixels. So make sure your Android version support Mirracast if this is important to you. I don't really need it myself.The construction of the project is great, it feel solid and should last. The projector has an internal speaker, which is nice. But I hook it up to an external speaker for more powerful sounds.The travel case and accessories are nice touches to make this convenient to use. Only complain here is the remote controller, it is rather difficult to open the battery door since it is the snap in type.Overall, I think this projector is great value and perfect for the budget-type consumers who care about getting the most from your money. However, for die-hard movie fans who are aiming for the perfect crystal clear picture quality, that is not the intend usage for this projector.\n","id":"9ab2c737-dd11-4093-8a3b-07272ec12b0c"},{"text":"\n  Edit: Upping this to 4 stars for the absolutely stellar customer service that Vankyo has. Even though I ultimately opted for another model, they made it right anyways as a courtesy for having to deal with 2 lemons. Out of the 3 models I've had/tried, this is the only one that gave me any trouble. I still highly recommend this brand and their products. You can't beat them on projector quality to price ratio.Review:This one is not bad but, I recommend getting the standard Leisure 3 (if you just want to watch movies or retro game) or the Leisure 460 (for HD picture and gaming).I have returned two of these now, and after the second return, I decided to get a different model.First off, the picture adjustments leavea little to be desired. There are less options to available to adjust with the pro, than with the standard Leisure 3 and you cannot adjust the preset color temperature unfortunately.2nd, the lens on the 1st one I got was smudgy and nasty on the inside of the device. That means I would have had to tear apart the new projector just to clean the lens. This probably was something that happened during the manufacturing process and could easily have been just someone accidentally touching the lens when installing it. However, I'm a little picky and so I did exchange this one.Unfortunately, the second unit I got had dead pixels right out of the box. The contrast is not as good as it was on the Leisure 3 OG for some reason (could be the faulty lens/lcd) and it won't focus in very sharply past 10ft in distance. This focus issue I believe is just the nature of the Leisure 3 Pro, although the OG Leisure 3 seemed to have more focal range too???Also, the sound quality isn't as good as expected. Still plenty loud, but lacks bass. I recommend using an external speaker. These are more like laptop speakers. Again, not terrible but not great either. Again, not sure why it was worse with the Leisure 3 Pro vs the OG Leisure 3. The OG Leisure 3 definitely sounded better. It could have been a cord issue on my end, not sure.Finally, the mirroring with your phone or tablet is not necessary if you already have a Roku or fire stick. Sure it's a nice ability to have, but you'll probably never use it and you have to download a special app just to make it work. This feature in my opinion is not worth an extra $20-$30. If you're planning on streaming movies exclusively from your smartphone or device, then this fills the ticket. Otherwise, you don't need one of these projectors with that capability.So in conclusion, the OG Leisure 3 or the Leisure 460 are both cheaper and much better buys.\n","id":"9b98b33a-5947-44da-992d-0f41fd063988"},{"text":"\n  Just received this today and watched one episode of umbrella academy season 2 via Netflix. I probably would have given this five stars for the initial review however the fan is really loud and I could not get it to connect to my Wi-Fi network even though it's on 2.4 gigahertz. I was able to use and Chromecast that plugs into the HDMI port the trick with this is that you need to have an external source for power but if you can get through that you'll be fine. The speakers are louder than I anticipated and while I do not plan on using them forever they did do the job they can still hear the cooling fan over them. That said voices tend to get quiet over those speakers. But for $139 or the $129 that I received cuz of the discount this is more than adequate for a projector in a very dark room or in a room with some indirect sunlight. My setup was and the basement and the kids play room where there's no windows so that was ideal. I will say it does go the distance as well I was able to light up the entire wall of a basement wall with a ceiling of 7 feet 2 about one foot off the ground but it is not as sharp as if it was a little bit closer. I ended up putting mine roughly 10 feet away from the wall as recommended and that still gave me a really good 90 to 100 \" and a very sharp image for this price point.I'll update as soon as I get a hold of customer service for right now I'm waiting them to reply back to my Facebook message for tech support.

It's not perfect but it will get the job done.\n","id":"d1d73fd3-386f-4cda-a756-39a4c5ebbf8e"},{"text":"\n  This is the second iBaby monitor I bought for my second baby. I love them! First of all I love night vision function, so I can see how my babies are falling asleep in their cribs. And also I love how I can chase my older one with the monitor as she keeps crawling back and force in her crib until she falls asleep.I think the Alert function is really great as my older baby sleeps in her room and I can sleep quietly, knowing that the app will let me know if she cries or even when she wakes up.Also I love the how I can talk and listen to what is going on. I went on vacation and I talked to nanny over the monitor!

This one cost more than double most of the previous options. It looks pretty and slick but it is not worth it.1. There are blind spots in the camera view. The Camera can look directly below it so if the baby crawls directly below the camera you cannot see them. Or if you install the camera above Baby's bed then you cannot pan down to see the baby while he is in his crib. You have to put the camera across the room to see the bed and even then you cannot see up close because of point number 2.2. The night vision is very grainy and not a clear picture. If you zoom in you can not see anything in the dark very clearly. It is fine when there is light on. Since you have to install it across the room you will not have the ability with this Cam to see your baby sleep, you can only get a general picture of movement in the bed.3. The Music feature on this piece of technology is total crap. about 40-50% of the time the device will not connect and the music is buffering and nothing plays. I have had better production out of a 30$ piece of equipment then this device.I really wish I had saved the money and gone back to get another device that would actually work.\n","id":"7618d346-eab8-4d7e-8c05-eaaaba5f8f9c"},{"text":"\n  I will say, I did a LOT of research when it came to getting another baby monitor for my second child. My first monitor was the infant optics DXR-8 which I feel is a fantastic monitor BUT I wanted a monitor that would connect to my iPhone so it could go farther. The infant optics, having a handheld screen that goes with the camera, it reaches to my neighbors living room which is a great range but this, the camera needs to be in a good range to the router in the house but my iPhone can be anywhere and I can see my sons room.This monitor worked in my daughters room which is far away from our router and also worked fabulously in our room which is much closer to the router. The picture quality is fantastic, I love that you can record videos or take pictures and I like that I can use the listen feature for the monitor and still be able to lock my phone and have the sound still be going. The movement with the monitor is absolutely fabulous but the only thing I will say is that I wish the movements were a little finer, you can’t make small movements, the smallest movement moves the monitor about 2 feet and I wish it could go a little less. That being said I still would 100% buy it again. The install was also amazingly simple. This monitor shows the temp and the humidity in the room which comes in really handy.I think the price point of this monitor is a little high seeing as though it’s only the camera and some of the cameras that come with a camera and monitor are cheaper but it still wouldn’t keep me from buying it again since I can watch my son perfectly with this monitor.\n","id":"ed40bc7f-dc6e-4a5a-97ad-400e4ba97a83"},{"text":"\n  Download and install the APP first.

Has grommets at all 4 corners which are important because since the panel folds you may need to temporary mount it for best sun exposure.  Comes with ways of powering a lot of devices including 12 V, car batteries, and more which could come in handy.  Customer service responded quickly to all questions (more below)The bad stuff:Customer service answers not always understandable. Between that and a poorly written manual it will be hard to figure out what some of the attachments/cables do unless you are electrically savvy.  I don’t own a Watt meter but figured this out using a Power Station.  The solar panel’s Watt output in ideal but real world conditions can only power about 65 watts from the AC output of the power station and keep the power station battery from dropping or going up in charge.  Since there is a power loss when converting the solar panels dc output to the AC output of the power station the actual wattage of the panel is higher than 65 watts, but I can’t say how much higher. Its not giving the full 100 watts in ideal but real world use conditions.  I am not electrically savvy, have seen wattage tests where framed permanent 100 Watt monnocrystalline panels output max 81 Watts in the same conditions noted here - given my lack of expertise in this area, to be fair, take this last point with a grain of salt.Stuff you need to know if you get one:The manual is not clear and does not address quite a few important points which are listed next.1. There is a red light and a green light on the gray controller box. The QA on Amazon lists the wrong answer as well even though it was written by their customer service.  The green light means there is sufficient charge output.  See below for a complete explanation*.2. To charge a car battery see attached picture which shows the correct set up.  Confirmed by customer service.3.  The adapters (manual refers to as “connector cables”) which connect to the end of the DC to DC 6.5 foot cable are in the other attached picture. There is no connector provided to charge a laptop with a USB C charging port.* When I asked TP solar customer service about the lights they responded that the green light on attached controller means its producing power, the sunlight is powerful enough for powering an appropriate device.  The red light will not charge a device.  I had the panel out at 8 am in less than ideal conditions and it did charge my Power Station battery slowly.  So in my experience it will charge in some less than ideal conditions if the light is red.If you found this useful click the helpful button, thank you!\n","id":"b48df31f-156e-4c32-985f-347f90b283c6"},{"text":"\n  I have a ton of rigid panels and few flexibles, even a couple folding panels in the lower wattage range.  This was my first larger folding panel purchase and I was feeling discouraged while shopping reading so many reviews of dismal output from many top brands.I've had this panel for a whopping 4 hours and just got it set up outside for a test.  The sun isn't perfectly overhead so these numbers may increase slightly, but I don't plan to angle it or anything - flat is better than anything I could rig up given the position of the sun right now.Immediately showed 74-75w being produced when connected to a Victron MPPT (see attached image).  I expected this number to fall as the panel heated up - it's 95* outside and it's laying on hot plywood with no airflow beneath the panels, or from anywhere - perfectly still wind-free day.So, 30 minutes later it's producing 72w.  The 2x100w series'd rigid panels on my truck are producing 143w right now and actually have good air flow.  So I'd say the output of this panel is a lot better than what I've read of Dokios and similar, producing 60w from a \"200w\" folding panel.It's heavy but that's okay, it rolls up tight and compact and feels more durable than my smaller folding panels.  The smaller ones I have can be flexed but these feel like unfolding a book of floor tile, so that's where the weight is coming from.  No other comments on durability though, too soon to tell.  Just feels like it'll last.  Unfolding it is straight forward, you just flip the 6 tiles open and then unfold the other 6 from on top of it.  I liked that because I could unfold without having the panel producing any voltage until I flipped the last fold over - one side covers the other until this point.  People who are familiar with throwing blankets over producing solar panels to halt current will understand and appreciate this.The flap that hangs off the side where the output box (or whatever you want to call it) is ok, I previously thought it was stupid when shopping.  Part of the flap has the output box and the other part is what wraps over the panels and velcros them shut when folded up.  I don't think you could use this panel hanging horizontally (landscape mode!) without that flap catching the wind and being obnoxious, and causing stress on the wires inside that lead to the flap.  But would be easy to hang vertically with the flap hanging down.If you review this item, try to observe the panel voltage and charge current going in to your battery.  That's useful info in a world of subpar folding panels that barely hit half their rated output.Oh yeah, wires.  Let's talk wires.  They're terribly thin on all the accessories.  I'm using a 10 amp 2.1x5.5mm jack as my solar inlet to my charge controller so I was able to use the included 2.1x5.5 extension cable.  The MC4 adapter and alligator clip adapter are both like 22 gauge.  It's very possible the 2.1x5.5mm extension cable is also high gauge.  I ordered a 16 gauge heavy duty 10ft 2.1x5.5 extension (but I'm realizing now I should have gotten a male to male - it hasn't arrived yet).  In any event, using as large of wire as possible from the panel's output box to your charge controller is always recommended to curb voltage drop.If you really want to give the panel the best shot at producing, get a 2.1x5.5mm male jack with screw terminals (they come in packs of 10) from Amazon and shove as large a wire as possible as you can in to them (12 gauge in my experience) and keep the wire as short as you can to reach where it needs to go.  This will allow more voltage to flow through the wire at greater lengths and in high temps.Ending review, this took me a while to type and its been at least another 30 minutes since I said it was producing 72w.  It's giving me 70w right now - barring a handful of days here in Colorado this is as hot as it's going to get.UPDATE after first trip: Took this to the mountains and laid it in the grass to charge up my LiFePO4 camper battery.  Had to use their included 2.1x5.5mm extension cable again as the heavy duty one I ordered hadn't arrived before I left town.  This was going in to a Victron 75/15 MPPT charge controller.  72*F ambient temps and mostly clear skies.  Didn't bother angling it, and the grass wasn't letting it lay perfectly flat either so it was a very slight bowl shape.  Was watching the charge controller over bluetooth and about an hour in to charging I hit 80w for a while... covered in bugs (adding new pic).  Would recommend.\n","id":"aee83e27-28fe-4f81-8fd4-fab170af2af6"},{"text":"\n  I love the compact design and the sturdy material used.

I'm upgrading from the Osmo Mobile 2. Off the bat the grip is more sensitive. The buttons are all still there, but the functions are assigned quite differently. Standby mode (introduced in Mobile 3) is a cool improvement.Gesture control is very neat. I looked like a Japanese schoolgirl while doing it, but it was effective and started tracking my face a second or two after I did the gesture, turning on a three-second delay to start recording.The Mimo app is definitely an improvement over \"DJI GO 4\". Mimo connects directly with the Photos app in iPhone, so you don't have to go through an app to access your photos/videos.There's two things stopping me from giving this five stars though:1. The magnetic clamp ironically, is the biggest downgrade of the new model. The ability to add heavier phones to the gimbal comes with a cost - it is noticeably less secure than the previous models. If you have a case, your phone will fall off the magnetically attached clamp (the one you attach to the gimbal) with any willful thrust or whip. This is why DJI offers magnets you can attach to your naked, un-cased phone. I haven't used them yet, but I'm sure that's why they offer both options.I also had some issues when panning an active target. The active target tracking requires excellent light and not too rapid movement from the subject and operator.

I have an iPhone 11 Pro. While the magnetic attachment can be convenient, there are issue:1) The magnetic phone clamp is too small to fit a case securely, even with a case as thin as an Apple silicone case. I'm doubtful the clamp will work with a case that has a square edge. It works OK with rounded edge case.2) Wireless charging doesn't work with the magnetic ring adapter, at least not with my Anker charging pad.3) While the magnet is strong, it's just not secure enough. If you plan to be active with the OM 4 there's a good chance you'll bump the phone right off the gimbal. I almost lost my phone while kayaking. Fortunately, the phone fell into the kayak and not into the lake.Other problems observed while using it over the weekend:1) I constantly had to re-calibrate the phone balance.2) I consistently had Bluetooth connection issues. When you only have a moment to take a photo it does not help when the gimbal cannot communicate with the phone without having to go through various steps to reset the BlueTooth connection.3) I used the ActiveTrack feature just once. The gimbal worked for a moment but despite the subject still being in the center of the display, the gimbal began rotating left and right over and over (like it was looking for the subject) requiring me to disable the ActiveTrack.4) Why does the gimbal always boot in portrait mode?

I was a little concerned that it would either be a little smaller than I wanted or that the lighting wouldn't be bright enough.  When I received the mirror it was VERY well packaged and nothing was broken. I plugged it in and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of light it gives off.  The 3 shades of light and the dimming capabilities are also better than expected.  I also had no intention of really using the Bluetooth feature, but by the 2nd time I sat down to do my makeup I decided to try it out and was shocked at the sound quality!  My vanity stool sits a little high so when I sit down the mirror is a little low since it is a horizontal mirror, so I purchased a small glass monitor riser and it's perfect and also gives a little extra storage space underneath.  I am VERY pleased with my mirror and would (and have) recommended it to anyone looking for a mirror to complete their vanity setup.\n","id":"97e5661f-68f9-4608-9c8a-6006d0e9ffa5"},{"text":"\n   Not sure how I can add pictures or video, because I recorded when I opened this item and the final product.

Simply put, this is a must read  for anyone working today.While I have experienced a lot of success over the last few years in business, the increasing addiction of checking email/messages and generally staying connected has weighed on me tremendously. It doesn't help that I am also a sucker for ESPN, the Wall Street Journal, and Facebook. Distraction has negatively affected my ability to be fully present with the precious hours I have with my wife and kids at home, as well as hampered my own self-confidence in how I manage my time each day. I always seem to be \"busy\", but know that I could better orient my time and attention to make room for things that matter most.With engaging stories, doses of humor, self-deprecation, crazy amounts of research, and tremendous insight, Curt Steinhorst seems to be peeping into my soul, giving words to my frustrations, telling me I am not alone, and offering very practical advice on how to get myself back on track. I'll report back when I have had a greater chance to implement some of the boundaries and strategies recommended in the book over a longer period of time, but I know that I am already starting to see fruit as a better manager, husband, father and friend, simply by naming the problem, recognizing where I am going wrong, and starting to do something about it.

I've never had my phone fall out but I've been too afraid to use it in a circumstance where it could fall out. The problem is that the clamp is covered in soft slippery silicone. There are small notches at the edge of the clamp to prevent the phone from slinging out but these notches are made of the same soft rubber, so the phone could still easily slide past them and fall out of the clamp. The tripod part is still the same high quality that you would expect from Joby, but the phone clamp just didn't meet my expectations at this price point.\n","id":"94c2bf5d-f8d8-44c7-bef0-b83701db41b4"},{"text":"\n  It will fit the iPhone 8 Plus and probably most ‘Plus’ sized phones.

Both of the them come in the kit and are very nicely packaged. In general, the stand is a nice aluminum and is very durable, while the plastic phone holder is made of a solid polymer with metal rods and springs. It grasp the phone very well, but it is not the most stable on un-even ground. This is holding an iPhone Xs, and you can see that there is room for a larger case as well. The arms on the back capable of expanding much more so I am positive that an iPhone Xs Max would fit. It works incredibly well for tables and desk, just know that it can not hold the phone in portrait orientation for FaceTime or anything. The thread on the mini tripod is standard size which will allow it to hold many other devices such as speakers, small cameras, and even larger ones. There is not enough friction in the ball joint to hold larger cameras though so it will try to lean if the lens is too heavy.All in all, I would definitely recommend purchasing this before they are sold out and lost with time. Nobody else makes anything this small and handy. It should also last a very long time with regular use. I would have purchased the tripod even if the phone holder did not come with it.

My use seems to be exactly what this is intended for. It looked and felt sturdy enough. It was not surrounded by rocks and I did not drive like a lunatic.

It's nice that it attaches directly to the threaded top of a mic stand without the need for any adapters, although a tube clamp is provided if you want to use it along with a mounted mic. There are other reviews out there complaining about it breaking when thrown into a trunk/van while still attached to the mic stand. It is only plastic (nylon?) afterall and I wouldn't expect it to take much abuse.I chose this one because one question/answer said that it would accept an iPad in a thick, Otterbox type, case.  My iPad is in a slim profile case with a plastic back and articulated cover - a real standard, thinline case available from many sources, and I prefer not to remove it.  While the mount will hold the iPad in this type case, it is clearly at the upper limits of thickness that will fit.  I seriously doubt an Otterbox case will make it.Bottom line - easy to use, nicely made but not indestructible.

My cats preferred this to their regular bowl I would always keep filled. The ONLY drawback is that you need a 2.4GHZ WiFi connection for the initial setup.

I looked at a few and decided to give this one a try as it would accept the most varied inputs, (USB, HDMI, Memory Cards, A/V, VGA and WIFI).  I tested it using a Roku and a Blu-ray player and experienced amazing results.  My family room has a light beige colored wall and the picture quality was incredible.  I can only imagine that the results would be even better with one of the portable screens intended for this purpose.As others have noted, you would want to view in a dim or dark setting for an optimal experience.

In his discussion of the research into cravings, the book really shines. As someone who has both taken graduate school-level neuroscience classes, and spent some \"time on the cushion\" (meditating), it was a fascinating book. However, it was deeply disappointing in one important sense, and unfortunately I am not able to recommend it. The critical problem is that it doesn't fulfill the second half of its title, \"How We Can Break Bad Habits.\" The book begins well and describes the methodology the author used to test mindfulness as an aid to cigarette cessation. He describes the protocol his program used to help the smokers. Great! The entire rest of the book, however, is about research and without practical steps that people can use to conquer their own addictions. Most books of this sort begin with research (building their case for the program they outline), and then they transition to active next steps suggested for the reader. These active next steps never happen. I started wondering if perhaps this book just outlines research and if perhaps the author hasn't formulated practical suggestions for his readers. The author mentions near the end of the book, however, that he DOES have a program. Brewer states that a former businessman met with him and outlined how the author could market the program to more people by starting a company that could help people stop smoking, quit emotional eating, etc., and this program has been out since 2013 (I believe). This book was released in 2017. If you want the practical steps that can really help you, you need to pay a $26/month subscription. If this book were intended to simply outline research in the field, I would've given it five stars. But knowing that he intentionally withholds his help from the readers of this book is something I find unethical. He offers readers nothing concrete they can do other than modify his smoking cessation program to their addiction. A better title would be: \"The Craving Mind: ...Why We Get Hooked and How You Can Pay My Company $26/Month to Help You Break Bad Habits.\"Furthermore, as an appendix to the book, the author mentions an ancient Buddhist text that defines character types with the intent to know what their individual struggles will be with respect to meditation and best be able to tailor their meditation training accordingly. The author has included a quiz you can take to see what your personality type is. Cool! Who doesn't love a good quiz?! But once the quiz is over and you have your results, that's the end of the book. Literally. There is no discussion AT ALL of what meditation struggles each personality type will have, or any specific tips. Why even include the quiz if he's not going to say what the results of the quiz mean? He doesn't even suggest a book or other resource that could give you the information.The author comes across as a genuinely caring human being, and it is puzzling to me that he doesn't offer people the help he's spent his adult life researching. I wish he would've at least given readers a list of suggested books or internet resources that could give people practical suggestions.P.S. I did not purchase the audiobook, but listened to it through an excellent (and free) program through my local library called \"Hoopla.\" This is why Amazon doesn't show it as a \"verified purchase.\"\n","id":"3d459472-56a1-4c90-9be6-dc2d64af885a"},{"text":"\n  For someone who is as educated as Mr. Brewer you would expect him to understand that a Buddist, such as he is, should not be doing studies on the benefits of meditation. Mindfulness and BF Skinner's 75 year old operate conditioning is not the answer to addiction treatment (because humans aren't rats in cage and depressed addicts can't meditate) and for a man who has never been addicted he should know as a scientist that meditating for 2hours is not the same as overcoming addictive cravings from dopamine deplition. The scientific method has failed here and been replaced by hypocricy, poor research and outcome driven studies. Read Sean D Young's Stick With it Instead. You'll get much more out of it.\n","id":"401541de-214b-42bc-9428-1f03bcf7dcfc"},{"text":"\n  Every parent, teacher and person who doesn’t know why they fall into cravings and habits should buy this book.  Cravings and addiction have reached new, epidemic heights and our youngest are the most vulnerable. Children are walking into traffic because they can’t disconnect from their smartphones. Parents are alienating their families and friends because their phones and facebook control them. And, distracted behavior (enabled through smartphones and social media) is the “new normal,” not the exception.  With this book, Dr. Brewer reviews the challenges many of us face, and then provides a clear roadmap that shows how to reduce craving, addiction and suffering (with ourselves, our children and families).  He shows how mindfulness can easily short circuit destructive habits and addictions.  Building on this, he discusses how to reduce distraction and increase focus so that we can better concentrate, learn, grow and be more complete human beings.  He illuminates meditation techniques used 2500 years ago to deal with craving, and then he tests these techniques (and their effectiveness) with Western science and technology in neuroscience and clinical laboratories with fMRI machines. The scientific proof is in the book.  This book can change your outlook, your behavior and your life.  Dr. Brewer has provided us with a gift that can help us be better to ourselves, and more complete, focused and happier with our families and society.  For me, I really loved the part of the book discussing states of effortless “flow,” that can naturally make us more joyful, focused, content and integrated as human beings. This book is brilliant: powerful, simple, elegant and complex. I have never bought so many copies of a book to give to family and friends in my life.

Brewer lines up the modern science of reward-based learning  with the ancient teachings of dependent origination culminating in a comprehensive, accessible approach to understanding human behavior.  And it’s not just theory but supported by Brewer’s research in the fields of neuroscience and addiction.  His mindfulness-based treatment model was twice as effective as the gold standard treatment for smoking cessation.The combination of scientific research and personal experiences presented in the book make the teaching clear and accessible. As a psychologist and meditation practitioner, I have to say this is the best book to date that integrates the science and the wisdom of mindfulness in away that can be transformational to anyone who ever had a habit they wanted to change.  Highly recommended.\n","id":"2d3992b2-eea1-4a51-acd8-a86060816eff"},{"text":"\n  This product is great and the manufacturer CTEK is very responsive to email questions.

This is bad for the car's battery and I bought this battery sense, along with the CTEK MUS 4.3 charger to make sure the charge level of my car batteries do not get to too low a level.A few things that you should know:1.  In most US vehicles, the nut size for the battery post is 6mm.  6mm nuts are also listed as \"M6\" in places like Lowes.  You will want to buy a couple of these 6mm nuts so that you can secure the positive and negative terminals of the Battery Sense to the battery without having to remove the exiting nuts on the battery posts.  With the extra 6mm nuts, you can simply thread them over the extra length of the screw and \"sandwich\" the Battery Sense terminals to the post.2.  The CTEK battery post does show voltage and temperature.  They are not on by default however, you need to go into Settings and turn on those displays.  They are shown when you tap on the battery and displays the details.One small quirk:  When you install the App, it ask for the device ID, which is part of the alphanumeric displayed on the device itself.  If you try to entire the entire ID shown on the label of the device, it won't work.  You'll have to enter only part of it.  Why would they do something like this is beyond me.\n","id":"6e2c91ae-1521-48aa-af9f-bfbae0ea2366"},{"text":"\n  The device itself is pretty easy to use.  Connected to the car battery fine. Bluetooth connects fine to my Samsung S7.The accompanying phone app is very poor though. It often has a hard time connecting. It crashes frequently.  It has screens that don't update sometimes.  The readings on the graph are sometimes questionable and confusing.  The chart shows a scale up to 100% (rather than actual voltage reading) and is often off the top of the graph so you can't see the measurements.  After a complete battery recharge (or disconnecting the device) it seems confused and takes 24 hours or so to settle on what the readings really are. During that time I see a steep drop until the voltage readings seem to settle in.  After that it looks accurate. It takes a reading every 5 minutes and the ups and downs correlate to the times the car is driven.We think we have a parasitic draw on our min-van and according to the graph the voltage drops about 0.1V between 2am and 7am every night. After a couple weeks the battery is dead (which prompted us to purchase this monitor). This matches up with my manual multimeter measurements.It works pretty well if you give it a day or two to get used to your battery.  I wish the app was better and that you could see and export actual voltage measurements.\n","id":"afcae9e8-ca5e-4f9f-b371-ced8842e88ee"},{"text":"\n  While the hardware may be of superior quality the app for the Android phone sucks.

One for the main engine battery & the 2nd one to monitor my Shuriken auxiliary battery installed in the trunk which powers my car stereo system.  I have read the complaints and I have experienced many of the same problems as you all have.  When it's working it's great when it's not, kind of sucks.  So after experimenting with different options & company recommended fixes, what I found out was when your phone gets an automatic update or another app gets an update it may cause your Battery Sense to lose connection.  What I did was just restart my phone within the Bluetooth range.  After the restart, go to your Bluetooth settings on your phone turn off Bluetooth and then turn it on again.  It should resync & update with the present time.  If it gets jammed up again, repeat the process.  The same goes for when you switch out or replace your battery.  Here I thought just closing & then reopening the app would allow it to update, how wrong I was.  I hope this helps.\n","id":"4b372b09-6a76-4100-b832-856e302e58bc"},{"text":"\n  I have charged my battery with the CTEK battery tender to 100% which was great.

I'm not sure the accuracy of this device or it just pulls too much power when hook up the battery terminal.Probably best to splice it to a cigarette socket that only powers on when the car is running.I would not recommend this product or hooking it up direct to the battery terminal.UPDATE: I drove the cars for about 30 minutes, the reading went 26% to 100% in about 5 minutes of driving while the other car went from 78% to 100% in about 5 minutes of driving time as well.

I bought this out of sheer desperation simply for the “ok to wake” function. My 18 month old had been waking between 5 and 6am for over 6 months, and literally nothing I did helped him sleep any later. We already had a cheap white noise machine, so when I first heard of this product, I balked at the price, thinking I didn’t need it for the other features. I first purchased a cheaper “ok to wake” product, but found it difficult to operate, and poorly designed and made. I finally purchased the Hatch Rest, thinking if it didn’t work out, at least Amazon would let me return it.Now, I had serious doubts about my 18 month old’s ability to understand and abide by the “ok to wake” concept. But mom needs a little time to herself in the morning, so I was willing to give it a shot despite my reservations. The beauty of this product is the app and Bluetooth capability. I set the clock for 6am the first night and told my son that when the light turned green in the morning, he could get up for the day. For the record, my 18 month old can only say about 10 words... but he seems to comprehend a lot. The next morning, he woke at 5:30. I wasn’t about to let him cry for 30 long minutes, so I opened the app, changed the wake up time to 5:35, and then when the light turned on, went into his room and did a big dramatic wake up. I said, “look, your light is green, that means it’s time to wake up!” I then turned on the lights, threw open the curtains... made a big deal of it. Over the next few days, I gradually set the clock back little by little, and he started sleeping a little later each day. After a week, I was able to set the clock to 7:30 (my ideal wake up time for him). He woke the first few days a little earlier, and I would just tell him through the baby monitor talk function that his light wasn’t green, and I kid you not— he laid down and went back to sleep until the light came on. Now if he wakes a few minutes early, he just plays in his crib and waits for the light. I can’t believe that this worked, but it did. And now I feel like I have to spread the word!I actually loved this so much, that I bought a 2nd one for my 3 year old. He loves it. He plays in his room until his light comes on at 7:30, and also stays in his room to play or look at books during “quiet time” in the afternoon. He loves choosing a nightlight color and sound on the app every night. I truly cannot say enough positive things about this product... try it!\n","id":"15ea77d3-1c87-4647-aa77-7fa7d4e903e5"},{"text":"\n  Extremely dissapointed, and my wife is returning the one we purchased.

Because the plug doesn't really work this thing gets unplugged to the lightest touch and doesn't have a battery option, so basically only turns on half the time. It is the most frustrating nightlight/noise machine to use at bedtime and nap time. Also, so difficult to manually adjust this when you are in a dark room, because you flip the thing over to adjust the volume (if you are not by your phone), and then it comes unplugged, noise and light won't turn on.

To be clear, this machine works via Bluetooth, NOT via WiFi.  This has advantages and disadvantages which I'll mention below.  Overall, though, there's a lot to love about this machine and only a few small quibbles I have with it.What's great about this machine:1) It looks stylish -- modern yet neutral.  And because the light can be just about any color, it can fit in with whatever color scheme your room is.2) It's easy to use.  The downloadable phone app works for both Android and IOS and is very self-explanatory.  Programs can be set to start and finish at any time each day (or set days of the week) and include settings for light color and brightness as well as your choice of sound (or silence) and the volume of the sound.3) The sound machine function produces a wide range of soothing background sounds: \"woodsy\" noise (crickets), rain shower, white noise (like television static), singing birds, ocean waves, rippling water, a laundry machine, and three different sets of melodies.  These sounds are surprisingly not nearly as annoying as I assumed they would be -- most of them are actually quite nice.4) The \"Okay to get up\" feature will be great when our little one becomes a toddler.  Basically, just set a program for a particular color to turn on at a certain time in the morning so your toddler knows it's \"okay\" to get out of bed for the day.  I have no doubt this will come in handy!A few things I'm not as wild about:1) The volume of some of the sounds could stand to have a wider range, particularly on the lower end.  For example, the white noise sound is quite loud, even on the lowest volume setting.  We have it dialed all the way down and it's passable but still almost too loud.2) The ability to program sounds and lights is a great feature, but it would be nice to be able to start a program on demand instead of only at a pre-set time.  For example, we have our \"overnight\" program set to begin at 9 p.m. and end at 6:30 a.m., but sometimes our little one goes to bed a few minutes before or after 9:00.  It would be nice to be able to start the overnight program with the push of a button at, say, 9:08 and have it still end at 6:30 a.m.3) As I mentioned above, this machine is controllable via a phone app via Bluetooth, not WiFi.  On the plus side, this means you don't have to plug anything into your router, and the connection is very easy to make.  On the minus side, only one phone can control it at a given time.  My wife and I both have the app on our phones, and if we are both close to the machine one of us might have to close the app for the other to use it.  Also, because Bluetooth has a relatively short range, you may not be able to control this machine from more than a room or two away.  Then again, this is a night light, not a baby monitor, so the \"need\" to connect to it from the other end of the house is not as great.I'm very happy with this purchase and would certainly purchase it again!*** UPDATE 12/18/2018 ***We have been using this light for almost a year and a half, and we like it so much we purchased a second one to use for our son who was born a month ago.  Although he isn't sleeping in his own room yet, we have the Hatch set up in our bedroom so he has a night light.  So, this is the first time we have used the phone app to control more than one device.  You can pair more than one device with your phone, but unfortunately switching between the devices in the app is a little cumbersome because you essentially have to \"log out\" of one device and \"log on\" to the other.  It's not difficult, but it seems like a lot of steps.  As I mentioned in my main review, I suspect this is because the pairing is via Bluetooth, not WiFi, which limits the complexity of the communication.  And as a reminder, only one person can be \"logged in\" to a device at a time, so if my wife wants to change the volume or the sound and I was the last person to make a change, she can't do anything until I log out on my phone.Fortunately this light will probably be used on a set schedule most of the time, so accessing it via the phone app is probably not something you will do very often once your have a set routine.\n","id":"8166b8da-fbd8-4b3e-9a12-9fe5cecdb59d"},{"text":"\n  Would recommend if you are looking for a good quality budget item.\n","id":"c862d64c-dfc2-4de1-8bee-ed344345fc55"},{"text":"\n  Wow!

It measures weight, BMI, body fat, muscle mass, body water, visceral fat, bone mass, BMR, protein, subcutaneous fat, fat level, body type, lean body mass, and standard weight. It gives you a curve for your progress for the day, month, and year for your weight, BMI, body fat, body water, muscle mass, visceral fat, bone mass, and BMR.

I'm not sure if it does read the bone mass etc, but I don't really pay attention to that on my other scale either since it doesn't seem that informative to me. I mainly care about weight.If you want to record the weight into your phone, you need to tap the measure button before stepping on the scale. If you don't want to record the weight, you can just stand on the scale w/o the app.For people who have trouble pairing: Make sure you step on the scale after starting the pair and during the countdown.

Since I got this scale, I learned my body type and which body feature I need to monitor and be careful of. I’ve been wanting to know what my body fat or muscle percentage are and this scale answered all of that and beyond. I feel that this scale will help me maintain a healthy weight.The app is very easy to use. There was a code given and you just scan and it’ll take you to download it.

My 8 year old has Asperger's and we often have to carry stuff for her to calm with and visual charts, headphones etc...not to mention all of the \"hey mommy can you please hold this moments?\" I found myself stuffing my purse full of their stuff when we're out and about or at parks. My shoulder would grow so tired and sometimes painful. I finally said I need a backpack. I looked high and low. Read reviews like crazy on so many brands. I watched YouTube videos as well. Looked at features for all of them. I needed something for my stuff and their stuff and that could hold a water bottle, but that didn't scream oh look you have a diaper bag or oh look she's going on a hike. I got the Knight Rose and am loving it so far! I just sorted all of my items from my purse over to this bag and there is so much room for the things my kids will likely ask me to hold. It's very sleek looking and definitely very spacious. Lots of compartments. I have a wallet I purchased from target that is just about too big to fit in the little pouch on top, but it does make it so no complaints. This bag takes care of both. mom and kids! So many little compartments. I won't be needing the changing pad that it comes with so I will utilize that back zippered part for something else or perhaps just keep it on hand for extra padding.I will update this after a few months of use to give proper review on durability and feel while wearing it.\n","id":"9f41a635-755c-447d-91c4-173977bf2513"},{"text":"\n  Great diaper bag!

Thus I purchased his book Rethinking Humanity. I have two issues with the book:My first issue is a very practical one; the book was printed in gray color type on white paper. Black type would have been far easier to read. The second matter is a bit more of a concern.While the first part of the work discussed such disruptions and was most interesting Tony and his co-author go on about how “we” ought to deal with these upcoming disruptions, lest we fall into a “dark age.” Now, the authors may well be correct, that without a unified preparation for the coming future events our civilization will, as every civilization which preceded us, fall into a period of discord, conflict and loss of knowledge (thus a “dark age”). My quarrel is with the recommendations made by the authors, and just how unrealistic they are.A few examples:The future will be led by “upstart” (my word) more adapt5able communities, in which the authors include cities, naming California and Seattle. I’m not sure how one or more of our states will take some sort of control over our nation.Our foodstuffs (including meat) will be generated by sophisticated chemical concoctions. Thus world hunger will be a thing of the past. Perhaps, but that’s really stretching it a bit.Governments ought to do such things as cancel high-speed rail link programs and create two lane highways which use autonomous electric road trains (which do not exist at this time). Really?They offer up numerous (highly speculative)  suggestions of this nature, which I suggest detract from the normally fact-driven observations I’ve heretofore seen from Tony.\n","id":"2ec99d97-256f-4183-ba93-880af18e3a5d"},{"text":"\n  The authors describe how key technologies will converge to \"completely disrupt\" the five foundational sectors that underpin the global economy (information, food, transportation, energy, and materials).They predict that the next decade will be the most disruptive in history offering unparalleled opportunity/upside, but also the risk of civilization entering into a \"dark age\" if governments/society are unable to adapt to the disruption/10x advances that are underway in the fundamental sectors of the economy.The authors identify repeating patterns through history, arguing that leading civilizations evolved ever-greater “organizational capabilities” in tandem with increased technological capabilities, with the best combination of technology and organizing system dictating the “winners”.They predict that over the next decade leading societies will move from a system of centralized extraction and breakdown of scarce resources to a new creation-based model of localized creation from “limitless, ubiquitous building blocks”.The book provides an action plan for governments, investors, and businesses to accelerate the breakthrough of the new “creation-based” production system and avoid pitfalls that could otherwise lead to a collapse/dark age.A must-read if you are looking for a “lens” to understand technology-driven disruption, where we are today, how we got here, and how the next decade may unfold!\n","id":"9512a436-319b-421f-91d7-51001ece03a9"},{"text":"\n  I have started reading this a number of times and given up.

They sound comparable in audio quality in my opinion except these have the bass I felt the L3 was lacking and the inclusion of vents that make them more comfortable. This set also includes much better accessories, a better cable and are Hi-Res certified for only $10 more.

Things have changed a lot since the days of Circuit City and The Good Guys (okay, maybe more than a 20 year hiatus). I tested many options, noted below, so you can get a frame of reference.My favorite iem is the ikko OH10. I was drawn to its musical presentation of instruments which sound natural and full. The sub-bass rumble and defined highs made it an even more enjoyable listen.I flat-out don't like: Final 7200 (soulless, no energy, but very analytical), Legacy 3 (boomy bass, instruments sounded not-quite-right), YGF-ISS04 (just a mess).I could see how others might like these, but they sounded off to my ears - either too thin/tinny or fake/plasticky sounding: FD1, KXXS, Shozy CP3 and Form 1.1, T2+.I liked these, but they were not as \"good\" as the OH10: Yamaha EPH-200, Tape, FH5, JVC/Drop HA-FDX1.But I quickly tired of the heavy OH10s falling out of my ears, so tried to make a custom mold using radians. I made a mistake, clogged the tube filter, and was on the hunt for a replacement (since the OH10s have been out of stock at Amazon for a long time).The FH3s are less expensive, much lighter, have better ergonomics, a more solid cable, and come with better accessories. I enjoy the sound just slightly less than the OH10s, but they are on the same level. The FH3 bass is very good, but compared to the OH10, it is slightly boomy with just a bit less sub-bass rumble. Vocals are every-so-slightly more recessed and I hear a slight \"grain\" in the vocals. The vocals on the OH10 sound true, as if someone was simply singing next to me, but the FH3 sounds like a recording - a great recording, but still not the same experience. Treble on the OH10 gave me a slight problem at higher volumes, but the FH3 has the detail I'm looking for without any discomfort. The number of \"wow\" moments I have while listening to music is about the same as the OH10s. But take all this with a grain of salt since my OH10s are broken and I cannot do a side-by-side comparison. When it comes down to it, I have a slight preference for my memory of the OH10 sound, but what good are they if such a hassle to wear (tried lots of different tips, but not spinfits)? If possible, I suggest trying out the both OH10 and FH3; they are similar styles of headphones and both great options.But if you want to know the truth, you've got to follow the money. I'm keeping my FH3s and not waiting for the OH10s to come back in stock. The FH3 is a great iem - I would purchase it over any competitors under $300. I haven't tried anything over that price, but I doubt there is a magical \"next echelon\" of iems which exist just above $300, so I'm sure the FH3 would compete in the $300+ range as well.\n","id":"568457ab-76b6-4d1c-89e3-08e9695850f1"},{"text":"\n  \"FiiO FH3\" (SpinFit CP360/Stock Cable/XDUOO TA-10 Amp) Phenomenal! Excellent bass, goes low with rumble with a quick fade and a soft yet felt hit, highs sparkle without any harshness, a perfect balance of warmth & brightness, mids have nice detail, vocals are not recessed and have a touch of life to them. I like them on the XDUOO Tube as it tames the bass even more making the iems clean yet have even a softer character to them which is absolutely beautiful, though they played awesome on my other amps, no complaints and the fit is awesome. Comparisons: It’s a step up from \"iBasso IT01s, It has a better resolving bass, just a touch more of it, has better clarity and detail, but the iBasso only has a single dynamic driver, so for how it sounds, iBasso did a wonderful job on it.  Next would be ikko 01’s, bass is more on the ikko’s, but the bass on the FH3’s is more resolving, quicker, and better imo. Also the clarity & detail of the FH3 is better, and the vocals are also a notch up in clarity and smoothness.  Here’s where it gets a little tricky, cause I was listening to the KZ ZAX, and it has better detail retrieval, good bass, not as defined as the FH3’s nor as quick, but it’s still nice. Treble is on par with each other, vocals are basically in the same position, but the vocals on the FH3 are a touch softer, smoother, sweeter. But the FH3 comes with as good cord, a nice case, and is all metal body, I like them both on equal ground and both are comfortable with basically the same isolation, not the best not the worst, but nice overall.  Another tri-bred in the same price bracket is the ThieAudio L3's(Not the Customs), I prefer the bass more on these, it's more refined and I prefer it more, also the vocals are better sounding to my ears than the L3, both have nice detail retrival, but I prefer the FH3's, though the L3 has switches, none of them make it sound better to my ears, though they are close.  The ikko OH10’s I find is warmer and is a notch up from these, but it’s the only other iem that I like better, but is also more expensive. I own the Tea’s, Fearless Rui S6, and I would trade them in a heartbeat for these(FH3’s).  Also I was kinda on the edge about buying these, cause everyone was saying how warm they are, but they’re not that warm, unless you’re coming from the other Fiio lineup, I find it to be a perfect blend of warm and bright, the best balance act of those degrees I’ve heard so far. As you can tell, I’m very happy about the FH3’s, it’s in the top 3 of about 40 iem’s I own, and yes I’m going to be listening to these for sometime if the One permits it.\n","id":"5c384fbb-d611-488e-9c25-74474a31d84d"},{"text":"\n   This mirror is amazing!!!

I was a little concerned that it would either be a little smaller than I wanted or that the lighting wouldn't be bright enough.  When I received the mirror it was VERY well packaged and nothing was broken. I plugged it in and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of light it gives off.  The 3 shades of light and the dimming capabilities are also better than expected.  I also had no intention of really using the Bluetooth feature, but by the 2nd time I sat down to do my makeup I decided to try it out and was shocked at the sound quality!  My vanity stool sits a little high so when I sit down the mirror is a little low since it is a horizontal mirror, so I purchased a small glass monitor riser and it's perfect and also gives a little extra storage space underneath.  I am VERY pleased with my mirror and would (and have) recommended it to anyone looking for a mirror to complete their vanity setup.\n","id":"986713d6-bd4e-433d-af74-4f39c159ba18"},{"text":"\n   Not sure how I can add pictures or video, because I recorded when I opened this item and the final product.

Then my brother bought one and was raving about how well it worked.  While I wasn't convinced it would really help that much, I like to stack the odds in my favor as much as possible so based on my brother's recommendation, I bought one.I am using it with a Wahoo Elemnt Bolt bike computer and it works perfectly.  It was extremely easy to set up both physically mounting it and wirelessly connecting it to my bike computer.  On my first ride, I was riding on city streets in a residential area at a time of day when the traffic was pretty light.  I had just glanced in my mirror and saw there was nobody behind me for several blocks when I heard the beep and saw the car icon on my screen to let me know there was a car close behind me.  My first thought was \"this thing isn't working\" but when I glanced in my mirror again, I saw a car had pulled away from the curb close behind me.  Over the next 20 minutes, I had several more experiences where the radar unit was picking up vehicles quicker than I could spot them in my mirror.I like that it not only beeps to let you know a vehicle is approaching you but it also beeps to let you know if the car \"disappears\" (parks on the street or turns) so you don't keep waiting to be passed by a car that is no longer approaching you.  On my second ride, I did about 30 miles of riding on county roads and that i where this unit REALLY shines.  It not only shows you that there is a vehicle behind you but also how many vehicles are behind you.  I was impressed that even though I could only see 1 large truck behind me in my mirror, the radar unit was showing there were actually 3 vehicles behind me and when the truck passed me I saw the radar unit was right.I don't plan to ride on the road again without one of these.  Now I would just like to get another seat post mount so I can easily move this device between bikes.  It is not that big of a deal to move the mount between bikes but I would really like to put a mount on both of my road bikes.\n","id":"a6dbc608-a28a-4d13-91ac-9847138c71c7"},{"text":"\n  I put over 150 miles on the Garmin RVR315 over four separate rides for a fair evaluation.  The device certainly adds another layer of safety and keeps you aware of approaching traffic from the rear, for the most part...I'll explain in a moment.  It integrates well with my bike GPS (Hammerhead Karoo) providing visual and audible warnings via bluetooth.  It is most effective in rural areas and can single out a car very nicely.  It urban areas, there are so many cars that you get overwhelmed with alerts, so not as useful in differentiating one car from the next.  There are just too many audible alerts to make sense of what is approaching.  The main problem with the Varia is that quite often there will be a visual warning (yellow status) on my bike GPS WITHOUT being accompanied by an audible alert!! Sometimes there is no audible alert at all!!  Other times, there is only an audible alert after the car passes and alert status goes to green...what good it that?  I may have a defective device and plan on returning it for a replacement.  I'll update this review after I test out the replacement.  In conclusion, when Varia works properly it alerts you simultaneously with an audible tone AND a visual alert simultaneously, and it gives you the opportunity to manage the road better and for enhanced safety. But, I don't trust it's inconsistent performance.  Without an audible tone accompanying the visual alert, what good is it?  Even if it did work perfectly, there is no substitute for the good old helmet mirror.  But, together they make a good team.\n","id":"9bf3513d-bce2-456b-a8e1-87f08f447b06"},{"text":"\n  This is a GREAT unit, and it makes me safer on the road.  It is ridiculously affordable insurance, a wonderful bit of technology, and an absolute flawless joy to use.I have multiple Garmin radar units, and have years of experience with them  This unit differs in that it is dual ANT+ and Bluetooth.  I chose the one without a taillight (first time that option has been available).  Why?  My e-bike has a super-bright taillight, and there’s a spot to mount this smaller unit that makes it quite stealthy.  Your application is likely different, so really consider whether the taillight makes sense.OK, how does it make you safer?  First, it isn’t a replacement for looking behind you!  It is an ADDED layer of security, and if you combine its audio alert (and excellent vertical array of dots, each representing a car behind you) with your visual operation, you will be safer.  The audio alert will perhaps make you alert (while daydreaming, looking at the scenery, or just not paying attention), and the radar can see farther back than you normally look.I have a Garmin head unit, so the Bluetooth feature doesn’t really help me.  But for those who use their phone as their bike computer, it’s great — the app is simplistic but effective.\n","id":"dc718fe6-2691-4171-8d34-82534d42e907"},{"text":"\n  With the Varia RVR315 now keeping tabs on what's going on 2 lanes left and/or right behind me, today's ride with the Varia RVR315 made the ride safer. While it won't prevent a from behind crash, it'll help noticing approaching cars before you eventually hear them, and gives you time to move further right (or left, depends).I use the Garmin Edge 520 Plus to pair the Varia unit. The roads this morning were not that packed, and so I could only see that the Varia RVR315 tracks at least 4 groups behind you. The Edge shows groups with a dot in the display, and their relative distance to you. A group is a single car, or two cars driving next to each other. The Varia can't distinguish, but it's sufficient to tell that there's approaching traffic behind you.I'm glad I made this purchase.

Canon Ivy's portraits look better (less sharp is good here), but prints lose detail in dark areas. HP Sprocket prints are a teensy bit higher res, better gradations of color, but slightly sepia-ish. See photos.BOTTOM LINEThey're both fun, easy to set up and use, and produce prints which any \"normal\" person would find perfectly acceptable, if not just plain awesome. ZINK photo paper packets are inter-changeable: I tried several kinds in both printers & found no difference in the quality, so buy whatever's on sale! Prints end up being about 50 cents each. (NOTE- the blue card in each pack is NOT interchangeable, so save the Canon blue card and reuse it when you use other brands of paper in the Ivy, etcetera. Also, I don't know if it's true for all mini-printers, but HP doesn't require the card inserted with every re-load.)DISCLAIMER: Both the Canon Ivy and HP Sprocket produced nice clear photos. I'm an artist and a photographer. A lot of my criticisms are for pixel-peepers and other weirdos like me.REVIEWI went into this with an open mind, looking for something that gave me \"good enough\" quality to paste snapshots into a casual travel journal at a reasonable cost. Having said that, I AM a serious photographer, so I did a lot of PREsearch, and I wouldn't have been surprised if I'd felt the need to return whatever printer I purchased. I bought both the Canon Ivy & HP Sprocket in order to compare the two, figuring I'd return one of them. HAH! I like both of them so much I'm not returning either, though I am giving one to my midle son, to justify the purchase. Just FYI-- he's a late-20s tech nerd, and, after test printing with me, he doesn't care which one he gets-- they are VERY, very similar.PRINT QUALITYI was happily surprised by the print quality of both the Sprocket and Ivy! There's a teeny bit of fringing I'd complain about in a larger/more expensive printer, but it's not troublesome in these small, just-for-fun prints. I'd also nit-pick about the sepia-ish tone of the HP prints. I tried a filter in the HP app and another in Snapseed, neither successful in offsetting the tone, and the HP filter noticeably reduced print quality, as did filters in the Canon app. Any nit-picking of the Canon prints would be due to loss of subtle gradations, especially in darker areas. For selfies, I preferred the slightly-glam looking prints produced by the Ivy-- my laugh lines were less noticeable! But for \"art\" prints, I generally like the HP better (resolution, no loss of detail in dark areas.) The HP also cost 2/3 of what I paid for the Canon.SET-UPThe set-up process couldn't possibly have been any faster or simpler. Slide the top open, drop in a stack of paper, and go. Connected immediately via Bluetooth, no problem finding chosen folder or photo on device.SIZESmaller than expected, very light, shiny, and slippery if you aren't careful.

The big difference between the Instax and this Canon printer+app is the ability to take a photo and add after effects on my own phone and then print the photo instantly on the printer. The 2 problems I have with the Instax camera was I couldn’t center the subject easily and also had trouble with the lighting exposure. I ended up wasting a lot of photo sheets trying to get it right with the Instax camera. However, with the Canon Mini Print app, I can see the photo and add text or other effects and then print the photo. This saves a lot of wasted photo sheets. The set up of the Canon IVY printer is super easy in that it just connects via Bluetooth and installing the photo paper just involves popping off the top and dropping in the photo packet (pics attached to review). The speed of the printer for this size is quite good at 25 seconds (video attached). Being rechargeable, light weight and small, it’s great to take anywhere and just throw in your backpack or purse and have the ability to print photos for people as instant mementos.

Two months in I could not take my sleep deprivation anymore! I decided to research into breathing monitors and everything I found was so so pricey! I then stumbled upon the SENSE-U breathing monitor. Not only did it have good reviews but it was in my price range! It was incredibly fast shipping and took me three days to fully trust it but once I seen it was accurate, I slept and sleep so well now! I've been using the SENSE-U monitor for one month and have had ZERO problems!I had one low breathing alert and it was MY FAULT! if the onsie is not tight the monitor won't be flush against the baby and you can not get an accurate reading.

The second package had two clips and one of those broke. It breaks when you try to place the sensor inside so it’s not user error as there is only one way for the sensor to be inserted.3) when my baby’s position changes the sensor alerts immediately.

I'm glad I did, as for a value product, it actually works quite well.It isn't without its quirks, that's for sure.  And some of those aren't really its fault.  It behaves a bit weirdly when connected with Bluetooth.  Don't get me wrong, it does work. But there are occasions when it does some odd things.  The biggest annoyance is that iOS won't pop up the built-in keyboard when this scanner is connected (either Bluetooth or USB), which isn't the scanner's fault, and it does include some barcodes in the manual that you can scan to cause the keyboard to appear when needed. Again, that's an iOS quirk, but something you'll have to deal with if using the scanner with an iPhone or iPad.The USB receiver that came with my unit fell apart the first time I pulled it out of its storage slot, and I had to glue it back together, but it did work. So it may be that quality control could be better.But in terms of its advertised functionality, it absolutely does do with it claims to do.  Programming it wasn't too difficult for the most part, though switching between USB and Bluetooth modes is a little confusing at first.  And once setup, it scans quite quickly. Not as fast as the Symbol units I use myself, but performance is quite acceptable.All-in-all, I wouldn't have an issue recommending this to someone looking for a budget-friendly bar/QR code scanner.

If I had to hit the brakes my phone would end up on the floor.  I looked at several car phone mounts but none would fit my gigantic phone.  This mount is awesome for a couple of reasons.  First, in my 2012 fiat 500c the vent where I installed the mount is near the top of my dash.  I can use my camera on my phone as a video cam while I drive for fun or security  Second the mount turns at an angle to face me when I drive. I had no idea that the speed limits were in the bottom corner of google maps while I drove as I had never had the opportunity to glance at my phone while driving. Cool design/works by gravity. When i drop the phone into the mount it hits the bottom of the mount which closes in the sides to securely grip the phone...I’m constantly removing and replacing my phone. I have a convertible and anyone could just reach in and grab my phone because I placed it near the top of my dash so when I hop out of the car the phone easily lifts straight out of the mount. No wrestling it out.  Super great product that arrived on time in a package small enough to fit in my little NYC mailbox.  The look is nice too. Like brushed steel. Oh one more thing. The clamp that fits on the vent to hold this in place is super chunky and secure.  As I said earlier,  it grips the vent tightly enough to allow swiveling toward the driver for great screen visibility while driving.  Driving at night, my phone can’t see me well enough to faceID.  The phone is mounted securely enough to punch in my passcode while driving without the mount moving at all.  This is the safe way to use the maps app. while on the road 🌼🌼🌼🌼.about a year later June 2020 the mount is now broken and will not hold the phone. I had a thicker case on my phone previously and when I switched cases the holder does not tighten up around the phone any longer rendering it useless. Too bad.

They load much slower than two other brands I have, sometimes freezing and requiring me to reset my iPhone app.There is no mute button so the only way to mute is to turn your phone volume down. A big hassle when you just want to view a cam for a moment and not hear all the background noise. The other two cams I own (Minion Cam and Zmodo) start muted.Works with the Echo Show, albeit a 7 second delay. Delay is about 2 seconds on the app. This is the reason I bought Kasa Cams. The other brands didn’t work with the Echo Show. I wanted easy to view cams for security and also the kids playroom.The reason for the low score is the fact that after 2 years, you cannot use the “free” cloud service without a subscription. You get a 30 day Premium trial which automatically converts to the “free” plan, but when you look into it, which you can see in the picture, it is only “free” for 2 years. I assume then you can only view live video for free. This was nowhere to be found in the product description nor in the many reviews I read. I bought the two outdoor cams specifically for security outside my home. If someone drops off a package at my door or steals something off my property, 2 days of cloud service is good enough to look back and find out. If it doesn’t record then they are useless to me and I’m not paying $40-$70 per cam/year for that service. Had I know I would’ve looked for a different company. I’ll get another 20 months of use then I’ll look for another brand. The other cameras I use I’ve owned for over 2 years and cloud service still works the same.\n","id":"7d94ba41-6be3-4a8e-b6de-e35824c043da"},{"text":"\n  When I purchased this camera I expected to have to wall mount it, but was delighted to discover it can be ceiling mounted under an eave, which trivialized my installation since an eave is much easier to deal with than a wall.  All I had to do was drill a hole in the eave for the cable (which is about 8' long), mount the bracket, thread the cable through the hole and stick the camera into its bracket (where it is held securely by a very clever magnetic ring, a superior design that makes it really easy to make small adjustments to the camera view).  To finish my install I simply connected the cable and its supply to an extension cord from the light socket in my attic and was good to go (I spent more time verifying the camera worked than in installing it).  Since I did a ceiling mount, the camera was upside down, but the Kasa app has a setting to turn the image upside down, which corrects for that.  Resolution is excellent, night vision is surprisingly good (much better than both my Ring doorbell and a couple of older Samsung cameras I have indoors), and lag is less than my previous experience with wireless cameras (I would guess about a second).  Response is a function of bandwidth, so you have to take that into consideration in selecting where to install this or any other wireless camera.  As an outdoor camera, it should be able to easily handle the indirect weather under my eave, but I can't say how well it would do in a more exposed location.The Kasa app is designed for use with smart phones and simply adds the camera to whatever other TP-Link Kasa devices you already have.  With the app you can set up to 4 motion detection inclusion zones by dragging the corners of a quadrilateral to set each one.  That allowed me to block off the curved street in front of my house to keep passing vehicles from triggering alerts.  The alert screen (bell icon) on the Kasa app gives you access to the most recent 2Gb of recorded video triggered by alerts (you set alert sensitivity according to time persistence of movement).  You can run the Kasa app on a PC if you install one of the Android simulator apps on your machine (I went with BlueStacks 4), which brings up the look and feel of your smart phone on your PC display.  When the camera goes live, you get a widget in the lower right corner that allows you to switch from portrait to landscape, taking the image to full screen, which sure beats the heck out of using a smart phone to catch details.  The camera has audio and a \"siren\", which are perhaps nice to have, but which I don't anticipate using (although if I spotted a perp I would certainly fire them up).  I verified those features work, although the siren is not one that would wake the neighborhood, and the audio quality is about what you would expect from a wireless device.  The audio pickup is quite good, maybe even too sensitive since I can hear leaves rustling.\n","id":"1ca8284b-6ba2-4a8f-a353-6deceab4a7a2"},{"text":"\n  Durable, easy to set up, great image. Ability to customize image quality to save bandwidth. I set mine to 720P that is fine. Ability to customize motion sensing areas. Does really well almost zero false positives. Night vision mode is great, can set to auto or leave it off if you have perimeter lighting at night and it’s not needed. Can set green LED status light to on or off...I keep mine off as I don’t want cameras too easy to locate. Magnetic mount for the camera is awesome. Makes it really easy to set the camera to the angle you want. Heavy duty water resistant. I have two of these installed now, they have been working great. I like that there is no charge for 48 hours of cloud video clip storage. Which is plenty. If you have alerts set on your phone (easy to set on or off), if you see something of concern you can download it to save it. 48 hours is plenty of time. Built in alarm siren that you can activate is plenty loud enough and you can set it to different durations. Live mode works great to see what’s happening. You can talk/listen as well in live mode and hit the alarm as needed. Sound that it picks up...mic is very sensitive. You can set auto record based on sound or motion or both...I keep sound notifications off. Too many cars, etc going by that trigger a sound event.  This is a great security camera for $139 and no subscription fee. Take your time on set up, do it inside and follow directions, then take it outside for install.

Before I bought this tracker I tried out the app on my phone to make sure it is what I want. I have been burned by so many track apps  so I dug. I really liked the layout and decided to try this tracker out. Here is my story.I received my tracker on time. I was charging and reading my booklet in the car on the way to my sister's house for a party. I was fooling around with it and bought my yearly subscription. About that time the food was done. I love food. Especially, when my husband does a low country broil and my sister makes cheese cake. It. Is. On. And I WILL be miserable with in the hour. So I hop up as fast as my little short little legs will go and get me some food. About an hour later, as I come out of my food induced misery, I realize I didn't put the tracker up. So I start looking for it. I can't find it anywhere. So I get the family to start helping me look. Well, I can't find it. The dang thing starts bouncing ALL over the place. It's like a squirrel on crack has done snatched this thing up and is taunting us with it. My brother in law said, \" maybe your phone is messed up out here in the woods (we were about 15 acres off the road) let me try it on my phone. Nope, the same thing was happening. My husband was like great. Another busted tracker that really isn't any good. Im like but it stopped. It says it's right here. We are looking ALL over the ground. It should be right at our feet. At this point we are thinking this is junk and we need to go through the trash to see if we can find it and maybe if we reset it it will work fine. I go through the kids pockets as my sister is getting ready to go check her mail. It wasn't in any of the kids pockets and my husband is fussing at me because I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached and I should be more careful with things blah blah blah. My husband and brother in law start walking to go get a fourwheeler and my sister drove off to get her mail. Well I looked at my app again and the tracker was on the move in the same direction my sister was driving. So I start hollering at my husband it's in the car! it's in the car! We're thinking maybe the 15 month old  stuck it in the grill of the car or something because the car was parked right by where we were eating. So my husband and brother and law go chasing the car and my sister down. She stops the car. And they are circling the car saying it's right here. My brother in law says it moves a little but it's like right here as he shows the phone to my husband. It's in the grill it must be it says it's right here. They have my sister dive forward a bit as they take a couple steps back and sure enough the tracker shows on live view the tracker moving forward ever so slightly so they knew it was the grill. They bend down to look real close to see if they can find it. And my husband being a mechanic ALWAYS has a flash light and a knife on him. So he reaches in his pocket to get a flash light... AND HE PULLS OUT THE TRACKER!!!!!!!. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 So Everytime we stood in front of each other and I was like it should be RIGHT HERE it was!!!!!I also forgot about the tracker and got a notification about a week later that said my batter was finally dieing 🤣So, I don't know why you need a tracker. But if you do, this is the tracke for you. And for size it's about the size of a man's thumb. 🙂\n","id":"8897e7bb-9835-48ac-a6e1-2107bd01f3da"},{"text":"\n  We bought this for our active cat. My goal was to monitor where he goes and how often he crosses a busy street, so we can decide whether to let him out in the future. I like this tracker enough that we might consider using permanently going forward, which was not the original plan.Things that work well:- You can set a very precise digital fence. I live on a normal sized lot, and it was important to me to know exactly when he crosses a street on our block (I care less where he goes on our property). I was surprised I could drag the fence lines so precisely up to the sidewalk vs the edge of our yard, etc. And the shape doesn't have to be a square - you can set any shape along any road/property line you need.- You can view a heat map of everywhere he went during the last 24 hours, and see where he spent more/less time based on color coding. It's hilarious. I use this to determine how often he's getting into areas that are more/less safe. See picture.- You get notifications when he enters/exits the digital fence-Live tracking (you can see in real time where he's moving around to) works well, unless he's in a wooded area. This helps me if I'm trying to bring him inside and need to know where to look for him and which direction he's heading at that moment.- The physical tracker has a secure connection piece to his collar, I don't worry about it coming off. Charging it is easy, and I find the charge lasts a few days at least. Note, I let my cat in and out (he doesn't come and go on his own). So it's easy to check the battery life before I let him out. If your cat has a door to come and go, I could see the battery life being a little annoying to monitor. However the app sends a notification if the charge is low, so overall I think battery life and charging work well here- I like the design and usability of the app on my phone. It's not clunky and gives me the info I want.Things that work less well:- Sometimes his position doesn't update for 30-40 minutes or more. So if I check on where he is and his last position updated 40 mins ago, I have to turn on Live Tracking to get a more current read. I don't know if the app would have known if he crossed our digital fence during that time, either. So I worry I might be missing times where he's crossing the road and could call him back. However, when I look at his historical heat map, the app doesn't seem to have gaps on his position.- The physical tracker is big for a cat. I eventually got comfortable connecting it to his collar only (not his harness), but at first I was worried it was too heavy for his neck. He doesn't seem bothered by it now. My cat is a normal size, about 12 pounds. See picture.- The activity/exercise tracking features seem unnecessary for an animal. I only use the digital fence, live tracking, and historical heat map features. Personal preference though- I lost signal once for about 45 mins when he went into a treed area. The app didn't tell me a signal had been lost, it just didn't update as normal, so it took me until an hour went by with no position update to realize he was off the grid. Live tracking wouldn't work, and I panicked something had happened to him/the tracker, since that hadn't happened before. Typical cat fashion, after I walked the block calling for him he popped out again on the app close to home after selectively ignoring my calls. I have a lot of evergreen trees and more mature landscaping on the block, but wouldn't call that area \"heavily wooded.\" So just be wary if you live among a lot of trees, you could lose signal often. This time, I did notice a gap in his historical heat map tracking for that period of time.- I really don't like paying for the gps tracking as a subscription. However, the app works well enough and I get a precise enough GPS location on him to solve what I need, so I'm willing to pay it in this case. I also felt the up front cost of the tracker was low enough to offset the ongoing cost.\n","id":"68b800c6-8763-4728-871c-d58c8a4099eb"},{"text":"\n  Very easy to set up and tracks the dog very well.

I didn't measure (I was in a hurry) but my supposed 8x8 pictures were larger than the matted size here, so the mat covered about a half inch around the edge of the image.

Tokaido is an odd combination of the Game of Life and Parcheesi, with a unique movement twist thrown in.  Tokaido is based on Tokai-do, an old road that runs between Kyoto and Tokyo.  The board is a representation of that road, with stops for beautiful views, hot springs, inns, and the like.  Every turn, the last player on the road will move as little or as far as they would like - no dice rolling, no spinning, you decide the distance.  However, you cannot stop at a location occupied by another player (the Parcheesi element), and all players must stop at the various inns for everyone to catch up.  When you make stop, you will engage in an encounter and various things will happen - too varied for this review - all of which are based around points or money (the Game of Life element).  You can also potentially gain benefits based on the ability of your traveler (there are 10, increasing the replayability substantially).It is simple premise, so I found myself surprised at the light tactical nature of the game.  Where and when you move matters quite a bit, as does when you move into an inn.  Your timing can both hurt your opponents and yourself if you're not careful.  On top of that, you need to decide whether to play to your abilities or worry more about hamper your opponent's.  While Tokaido won't win any awards for it's strategy, it will keep your brain engaged enough during your play.The theme and the art are what really steal the show and bring the game to the table.  As noted, the game is about a journey, a peaceful walk in a slower time.  Everything is (digitally) painted in bright watercolors, with quite a bit of variation within each type of encounter.  For example, when you draw a meal card at the inn, there are 10 or 12 different food types.  It is a pleasant experience to play this game on a cold rainy day; with a bit of imagination, you really feel as though you are travelling along the coast of southern Japan.To me, it is that ability to inspire the imagination that puts Tokaido into the 5-star territory.  Once the mechanics are explained, our house rule will be that you don't receive your points unless you role-play the encounter.  There is enough variety among the encounter types - and of course the imagination is limitless - to turn the game into a great story-telling game!  On top of being great for kids, it helps make the game remain meaningful even when you are in last place.  Even if you don't play that way, you will find yourself writing a story in your head.I would strongly suggest this game for any family and as a light breather for game groups.  It is a simple game, but one that can still make you smile if you let it.\n","id":"21192914-35de-45b8-9eba-75d13a08c3dc"},{"text":"\n  Tokaido is one of the loveliest games I’ve ever come across.

Couldn’t recommend it enough!\n","id":"e7420f61-8402-4c27-a111-2d4b9765dfbd"},{"text":"\n  Tokaido is a relatively simple game that gives you a very relaxing feeling while playing. We'll often play it after a heavier game just to relax a bit. The rules are very straighforward. Each player is a character with a special ability that will help you when you stop at specific spaces as you traverse the path. Decisions are fairly easy: stop at a location, pick up the corresponding card and gain immediate points, choose to purchase it or leave an offering at the temple. Almost every action will give you some points so it minimized analysis paralysis.Turn order is determined by the person last on the path. If you move too far ahead to claim a space, you're allowing your opponents more time to move and gain points. There are several locations where everyone will catchup before you proceed on the path so no one can really get too far ahead.The artwork is beautiful and adds to the zen-like experience of playing. Actions you take against another player appear very subtle since all you can really do is block them from taking a certain space but then they may take a space you really want.This is a good game to introduce non-gamers to or to people that just want a relatively simple game to learn and play.\n","id":"c2d171c9-9521-438a-bc16-dcc2d8909efc"},{"text":"\n  This game has a lot of rules, but you can just use your first round to figure everything out and then you're good to go!

Yes, it does take some strategy (unless you choose to la-de-la your way down the road and just enjoy your trip or something). The artwork is soothing and there are no negative points (bad events) so it is an uplifting game, even when playing with a conniver.\n","id":"173631ca-5eae-48a8-96e6-9027f4012c65"},{"text":"\n  I had no idea I would find s new use for it, but I did: Because the case has a charging slot, I am able to use my wired Bose headphones while biking.

I've read the book and I'm not sure that I've gotten any better. But the book was informative and helpfulThe first two chapters on basic camera information is pretty straight-forward. There are a few exercises for taking photos (with a flash, with the timer, etc.) that are helpful, but most of us who have had an iPhone for more than a couple days know all the features. That said, there were some nuances of settings that I hadn’t realized, so it’s worth the read-through.Chapter 3, titled “Setting up your Camera for Photographic Greatness” is probably the best starter-chapter that I’ve seen on how to adjust your iPhone settings for photo use. It should be mandatory reading with every new iPhone. I felt I was pretty well-versed in the settings-aspect of the phone, but this provided more explanation and common-sense tips on exactly what to adjust, and more importantly, why to do that. I liked this chapter a lot.The rest of the book certainly still gives specific examples of how to use your iphone, but I fell that the rest was a general lessons on how to take good pictures, and that is helpful in and of itself even if it relies less on the iPhone itself as the picture-taking device.All together it's something that I would probably have been better off getting from the library, except that I like to make notes and dog-ear pages.\n","id":"8efee520-9d86-42e4-b8ea-fb0234735e13"},{"text":"\n  I consider myself to be proficient in taking and editing iPhone photos but I felt that I still could learn more, especially in regards to action shots.

I am able to cast my phone directly into the projector via wireless connection. There is no much lag but the definition suffers a bit. The connection is stable though.

The speaker quality is manageable, but would recommend plugging into external speakers if you are looking for a full home theater experience. My favorite is that Ican connect my iphone to this projector directly with a USB cable, and I don't need to buy an extra adapter.

I have severe winter eczema. It's painful and constant, dry flaky bloody skin. These gloves make my hands baby smooth in a matter of minutes. I don't know how it works exactly. There's a gel inside the gloves, I'm guessing it works similar to applying petroleum jelly. It doesn't really moisturize, but it prevents more moisture from escaping. Unfortunately the effects are very temporary, so I have to keep the gloves on for long periods of time. Sometimes overnight with lanolin on under them.

And I wasn’t disappointed. It is well written and provides a wealth of information and insight. Much of it, I found, reinforced my own observations of my daughters. In some cases, that allowed me to breathe a sigh of relief. At the very least, their habits that are the most different from my own at their age are not unique to them.Twenge is careful up front to articulate the limitations of this type of statistical analysis. “Because the survey samples are nationally representative, they represent American young people as whole, not just an isolated group.” That larger group, the iGen’ers, are defined as those born from 1995 to 2012, a group of 74 million Americans that currently account for 24% of the population.One of the things I normally find limiting in this kind of big data statistical analysis is that it chronicles attributes. But if a picture is worth a thousand words, a behavior is worth ten thousand pictures, and Professor Twenge clearly appreciates that. She doesn’t just present the data, she probes it.A few random thoughts occurred to me as I read it.I came of age at the height of the Vietnam War. When I was required to register with Selective Service, the draft was still in place and college deferments, for good reason, had been eliminated. I vividly recall standing in my high school cafeteria at the age of 17 listening to the statewide announcement of our lottery draft numbers. The numbers were drawn by birth date and the official reading the numbers started the broadcast noting that the first 123 numbers drawn were almost certain to be drafted, the second 123 numbers may or may not be depending on need, and the last 119 could rest easier. My birthday was drawn 124th. The birthday of my friend, who happened to be standing next to me, was drawn 3rd.I offer that only to suggest that there are certain historical events that help to define individuals, if not a generation. The risk of being sent to fight in the jungle of Southeast Asia was one for me. That’s not to say that iGen’ers have not endured such historic events. It’s just to remind us that they exist.The other observation that I had, which isn’t directly explored in the book, is the change not just in how we live, but where we live. I walked to school on my own starting in the fourth grade, road my bicycle everywhere, and spent nearly all of my waking hours with friends—with no adult supervision. People didn’t live in sub-divisions so much in those days. We lived in economically diverse neighborhoods. Urban sprawl and the socio-economic homogeneity of the suburban subdivision have both empowered and demanded certain changes in how our children live.My final observation has to do with the individualistic versus collective social norm. Professor Twenge writes, “…cultural individualism is connected to slower developmental speeds across both countries and time. Around the world, young adults grow up more slowly in individualistic countries than collectivist ones.”My family lived in China for nine years. For my daughters, it was during the period from age 5 until age 14, on average. China has a collective culture in the extreme and it was my observation that the children matured very slowly, at least compared to my personal experience as a Boomer. (I found out from this book that this is a global development.) Because of the collectivist culture, however, my wife and I were very lenient with the independence we allowed out daughters. At a restaurant, for example, we never hesitated to let the children go off and play on their own, out of our sight. (A children’s play area is offered at virtually every restaurant.) Violent crime and attacks on children are rare in China, but more importantly, we knew that everyone else at the restaurant, including the staff, would keep a close eye on the safety of the children. It’s just part of the collectivist mentality. They all feel responsible. My point being that I’m not sure the individualistic versus collectivist dimension isn’t a bit counter-intuitive when you get to the social extremes.The study does reinforce the far-reaching impact of technology. It comes with a lot of baggage. Social media is not social at all. It’s entertainment. And, for the most part, it’s not authentic. Selfies, for example, are always staged. Reminded me of The Jetsons, when they would always hold a mask of perfection in front of their face when talking on the video phone.In many ways, I consider this book to be a launching pad rather than a conclusion. Professor Twenge has done a great job of starting the conversation. But it needs to continue. What is it about technology that has cast our children in this way? Why do they think and behave the way they do? (Twenge has started that conversation in many areas.) And what, as parents and members of the larger community, can we do to reinforce the good things (e.g., our children are safer) and attack the negatives (e.g., suicide rates are up).Some of the developments are going to be a little tricky. Twenge points out, for example, that iGen’ers are overwhelmingly inclusive. In terms of the racism that is haunting our society today, that might suggest we just need to wait and the problem will be resolved. I don’t think so, and, to her credit, Twenge apparently agrees. A commitment to inclusion is not enough. We must do more.I also think it will take the village to address the iGen’ers overwhelming anxiety about their financial future. That is truly a problem for the business community and the government to solve. The implied social contract that existed between employer and employee when I started my career disappeared starting in the 80s. It isn’t coming back but we have to build some form of alternative. Technology and social evolution have taken away the safety net of self-sufficiency (i.e. the Thoreau model) and have left a void in its place. It’s a void that needs to be filled; or bridged, perhaps.I, therefore, go beyond the parents of iGen’ers and educators in recommending this book. We all need to read it because we all have a role to play, both for our children, our selves, and the future of our society.\n","id":"a1544ae6-da1e-4c71-8757-de9190e7c2d0"},{"text":"\n  Born in 1996 and now in senior year of college at UCSanDiego. And everything in this book has seemed to ring true for me, and of the students around me. For me, I'd say screen time and reliance on texting/messaging instead of real conversations was a big factor in my lack of social skills in high school leading to much social and romantic failure; the sapping of social media; the constant sleep deprivation in high school (constantly felt asleep at the wheel driving to school though never crashed, and often in classes). I have deleted facebook and all that validation-hunting antisocial social media. This book has been very eye-opening to see how my generation is sadly faring.

I know Millennial kids - and our kids exhibit all their bad habits and more.  So I'm glad someone finally noticed that this IGen subset is different and deserves its own category, if only to study them independent of Millennials.  We gave cell phones to the children when they got their drivers licenses - just the cell phones to talk and text; we never bought them smart phones at all.  When they began working summer jobs, we advised they buy the more inexpensive Ipods in order to avoid the expensive service plans, but they would have none of that.  Now as young adults, they are absolutely tethered to their smart phones, and their service plans are one of the biggest items in their monthly budgets (in spite of having WiFi everywhere) so I'm not sure holding them off made any difference at all.  And where will this lead?  The book ends with a giant question mark.  I gave this book 4 stars because I felt the content could have been condensed into a long article - maybe in The Atlantic or the New Yorker.  Then again, perhaps I am so spoiled by having a content-rich environment on my own smart phone, I no longer see the value in purchasing a book.

I know this mount is meant for tablets but I have only used it for my large Galaxy Note phones. I'm happy it it for the most part, but I would desire some improvements. This does work better than the normal sized mount meant for phones for my heavy phone.This has held my phone well on most days. I do use both the metal plates it comes with, lined one below the other on the back of my phone, but I find that this allows me just slap my phone on it without having to strategically place it on. This also prevents the phone from sliding or falling off the mount.I have not stuck the metal plates to my phone nor my case, instead placed them between my phone and case. I like switching out my case every so often so I like that I can move the plates from one phone to another.Because of the way I place the metal plates, I can't always use this with all of my cases, especially if the case is too thick. It works best with flat backed cases and/or dual layered cases, where I would place the plates between the layers.One major con is that if my car I parked in the heat, the suction cup of the mount will detach from the base plate it adheres to. You don't notice this until you start driving and the weight off the phone pulls the mount off. I usually have to let the suction cup completely cool down before I can attach it back.

I thought of sanding it myself, however, after giving it some thought, for $32.95 I decided that it should have already been sanded and made with more care. Also, soft cloth glued to the walls of each slot would be ideal, as no one would not want their devices to get scratched. I had to return it, no matter how much I liked it.\n","id":"67cf2192-d9fe-4b74-99b5-9d0f19c77192"},{"text":"\n  EDIT: Two years in and this item still astounds. It's quite simply the absolute perfect item for the job. Currently it's holding an Ipad Pro 12.9, two 'normal' Ipads, A kindle Fire HD 10, and Kindle Fire HDX, all in their respective cases. It holds them perfectly and has never once failed. The durability is great, no chips scratches or problems what so ever, in any way. When I came here to leave this update, I notice they now offer a black leather version. I'm very tempted to get that one as well.This is one of the best purchases I've ever concluded on Amazon. I can't recommend it high enough.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This organizer is perfect for what it's supposed to do. I'm a firm believer in using the correct tool for the job and this item is exactly that. The workmanship is very nice, the baffles are even and straight and the corners nicely rounded so you don't end up scratching your tablets or electronics. I had a slowly amassing number of Ipads and tablets and once I recently purchased an Ipad pro 12.9' I was seriously in need of a way to store them that wasn't just piling them all up some where and hoping my toddler didn't find the stack amazing and knocking it over or flinging them about. I did some research and came across this item.The baffles are nice and tall, which seemed good to me. There are many organizers out there with 2 inch or less baffles that seem to rely on tension of angle against the baffle to keep the tablets or electronics in place. That seemed risky to me and to put pressure on electronics that we've paid $100s or $1000s for. This one has nice tall baffles so that's not the case. They're wide enough to accommodate the tablets with out them being wedged in as well. The description rates the space between as an inch and having it in hand, I've measured and this is exactly true. It's the perfect fit for my two standard Ipads and the ipad pro fits in with room to spare. (In width). I've even got a kindle fire in one slot in a pretty thick padded case. No problems.The only 'concern' if you could call it that, when ordering was the light shade of the bamboo in the images. I have a rather dark design style in my home and office and thought it might stand out a bit being such 'light' colored bamboo. To my surprise and some what delight, the unit I got is stained a bit darker than the images here. It's not 'DARK' brown or anything but it's a good three or four shades darker than the bright images shown. So I very much lied that.The unit is solidly constructed. It feels very solid and firm with out being 'too' heavy. You want a bit of weight when you're putting hundreds to thousands of dollars of equipment in a holder, but you don't want a brick. This fits that middle ground perfectly. Another slight change, in the images shown, the bottom is 'smooth' with the 4 grippy feet. I found that mine also had each baffle individually screwed in with multiple small screws. So it's held together not just with wood glue but actually a number of small screws. This will aid in retention and strength over time.So it seems they've improved on the product shown in the description.All in all an easy 5 star rating for me. Highly recommended if you need a tool for this job.\n","id":"771308dd-82bc-463e-b938-a833c9332559"},{"text":"\n  We have had this for 2 years next month, and it’s still a good product. I can’t speak for durability much because I’m the only one that uses it and I’m careful. I also can’t say whether it will hold laptops or not. I can say that it holds a 1st generation iPad, a slightly newer large iPad, two mini iPads, and two phones in the front with no problems at all. All iPads have thick covers on them too and are the reason I chose this particular one, because the inserts are tall.  I’m still happy with it.

Several articles rated this model as the best inexpensive drone for beginners so I gave it a shot. Overall, I was very impressed how well this thing performed for the price.-Flight time: You can about 10 - 15 minutes flight time depending on what you're doing. While it doesn't sound like a lot, it feels much longer. For longer time, just pick up an extra battery and swap it out. The battery takes about an hour and 15 minutes to charge. You charge it by using a microUSB cable connected to the drone (not included)-Setup: You download the app from the app store and connect it to your phone using a Wifi Connection. Setup was maybe 3 minutes. Tip: If you're on Android, once you connect to the Drone's Wifi, wait for your phone to say it's connected to wifi network but there's no internet and then tell it to stay connected anyway (usually takes about a minute). Once it does that, it's fine but it took me awhile to figure that out. It's clearly an Android issue and not the drone because I have the same problem with Smart Outlets / Amazon Alexa setup.-Flying: It's really easy to get the hang of flying this done. I've flown it inside and outside and even with a breeze, it was pretty easy to control. It went as high as 30' or so (one picture is of a neighborhood over a 2 story home). By default, it's on a slow setting which is better for indoors. If you're outdoors, turn on the fast setting and this thing really zips. It has a really long range and was able to control the done over a distance of more than  baseball field. It easily hovers in place and is actually quite stable to control. It does need a good amount of ambient light to operate though. The drone has sensors on the bottom that it uses to look at the ground and stabilize itself. It works amazingly well but had some problems when being used indoors in more dimly lit rooms. This will not fly at dusk or night.-Picture/Video: The picture quality is really good for a 5MP camera mounted on a drone. You could come out with some neat pictures with this. The video feed on the phone itself when you're flying it usually has very little lag but the video saved on your phone can be choppy at time. It's decent enough for a drone in this price range, just don't expect professional level video. Also, the camera on this drone is fixed (always facing forward) so don't expect to angle it down for a bird's eye view.-Durability: Reading over reviews of other drones, I never understood why people kept talking about crashing them, but as a beginner you're going to crash the drone a lot. I've hit halls, ceilings, trees, the ground and many other things. The drone just stops itself, you put it flat on the floor again and tell it to take off. It's remarkably durable and haven't had any issues with it being damaged. It does come with a few replacement propellers if you need them.Overall, it's a really fun toy and a great way to start with drones. It's really well built and powerful for the price and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to start playing with drones without spending a ton of money.\n","id":"cb43fd85-3e0d-41d6-822c-2b9dc18010e5"},{"text":"\n  Tello is a very good toy drone for beginners because it can hover in one place on its own (with good lighting conditions)Pros - lightweight and easy to maneuver, decent 5 MP camera that takes nice pictures and videos (for the money it is actually the best), fairly easy to control with your cell phone, pretty durable (fell several times on concrete from about 10 feet with no real damage to the props/body, just keep the prop guards on);Cons - too lightweight (you can't fly it in any wind over 5 mph, I tried, it flies away lol), Wi-Fi connection is spotty and its range is limited, updates are hard to install, once it's dark the drone stops 'sensing' the ground which is a problem because then it can no longer hover in one place on its own and it's hard to land it.The drone's greatest asset is its camera, I enjoy using it indoors.  Just know its limitations and you won't be disappointed.Update: I recently got a Xiaomi wi fi range extender for the Tello and it does increase the range a lot!  I watched a couple of instructional YouTube videos before connecting the Xiaomi, and luckily there are also some helpful directions on the package itself (after you create an account you can easily change the region, like U.S., China, etc so it's better to just play around and see what region works for you).Second update: so it's been a while since I got it, and Tello is still flying fine.  One more thing to consider: with prices on drones like DJI Spark and Yuneec Breeze (you can get it as low as $99, since it's at the end of it's lifecycle) steadily coming down, and new players entering the entry level drone market (like Xiaomi), you might want to save a bit more and just get a Spark or a similar drone instead.\n","id":"87267514-8c43-474f-9edb-c4a716395f20"},{"text":"\n  IF YOU'RE CONNECTED TO TELLO'S WIFI ON ANDROID, BUT THE APP SHOWS BLACK, TURN OFF YOUR PHONE'S DATA.It does what it does very well.  That's part of the problem.  Cheap quadcopters are a challenge to fly.  Expensive ones are very capable.  This one is great for learning to fly, but it can't do much and it's not really a challenge.  By 'do much' I mean that without gps you can't program flight paths or return to base or whatever.  You're also limited to 10m altitude.  With no onboard memory card, any pictures or video are degraded by the wifi signal, so, as good as the camera is, unique high-altitude pictures or video are not as good as they could be.  High speed mode is limited by how well you can see the drone, because the camera is always tilted down (and a little laggy) so it's impossible to fly by camera.  Of course fixing all of this would pump up the price and you'd end up with a drone 5-10 x the price.Don't get me wrong, it connects well, it flies well, it takes pretty good pictures for perspectives that my camera can't get.  It's pretty damn stable in low wind, using an undercarriage camera and other sensors for position stability.  It's under 250g, so you're not forced to register it in the US.  The screen controls are good enough that, if I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy the single-use T1d controller that can't do anything but the Tello.\n","id":"862d1c2a-8163-4351-86da-64f70a2dbc5a"},{"text":"\n  Tello needs to get their stuff together.

In the description it is described as \"Mineral-based SPF 50 broad spectrum zinc oxide protection\" and promotes a 'natural ingredients' image which is what I was looking for.  Yet, I just received my bottle, looked at the ingredients and it contains the typical sunblock chemical Octinoxate which is known to pose numerous risks to humans as well as the coral reefs.  The chemical is made with a petroleum by-product, and it doesn't just stay on your skin, it is absorbed by it... this chemical has been found in human blood, breast milk, & urine.  Octinoxate caused complete bleaching of coral even at very low concentrations and for this reason, many resorts near coral reefs actually ban this kind of sunblock and require beachgoers to instead use biodegradable sunscreen. Companies that use 'natural ingredients!' marketing which are actually peddling the same trash that is ruining our planet make me sick.\n","id":"ad8168e8-1215-4b0b-a311-2e1bb77975e5"},{"text":"\n  This is it, after all these years I've found the holy grail of facial sunscreens.

I usually use Yes To or CeraVe (which are great products) but the heaviness of the sunscreens can make you hesitant to want to use them daily. This stuff is perfect for under powder foundation. Presuming it works well in the actual sun (as I only just received it yesterday) I won't be buying any other sunscreen for my face ever.Updated to add: years later and I’ve used it in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and on countless backpacking trips in high elevation sunny areas, and every day in my daily life (which is often on the beach), and I swear by it.

Updates are to be done via wifi or usb connection to a computer.  Took me 1/2 day to successfully download US, Canada & Mexico maps (usb consistently failed but was finally successful via wifi).

Used our older Garmin to compare.  The Tomtom was trying to take us along some really bizarre routes which were completely illogical.  Our trip from El Paso back to home in NM was pretty much a 45 mile straight shot along I-10.  We set the GPS preferences to take us along the fastest route (umm, that would be along I-10, yes?).  Nonetheless, the GO 620 repeatedly tried to take us off I-10 onto some farm roads - and then, amazingly, back onto I-10.

The first shortfall is the software they want you to load to your phone. The MyDrive app is actually just malware.  The app NEVER shuts off, and spends the day burning up your phone battery and spying on what you're doing. I finally uninstalled it off my phone. Again, this would have made this such a great product, but corporate greed for customer's personal data drives their company paradigm. Example: I drive only a few short miles a day normally. But the app, even though it senses that it is no longer bluetooth connected to the device, remains fully on. Not just a small \"stub\" to sense when it's near the device and connect, but I mean fully on watching you, listening, tracking communications with others, and robbing as much data as it possibly can. The other important area it falls short in is the device's user interface. There is almost nothing intuitive about their GUI. For example, if you're on your way home, but you want it to stop telling you how to get there, you have to dig through THREE menus (WHILE DRIVING) to turn off the trip!! But, if you want to report a traffic camera - there's a prominent button right on the screen. I wanted to add the location I was at to my favorite destinations, rather than typing in a bunch of info. Guess what - I STILL haven't been able to find how to do it. The online help from Tomtom has old information that doesn't apply to my model. I still don't know how to do something that basic. There is a lot of stuff that is great about this device, but corporate greed, and inept user interface design totally negates that.

And I even see it when I stand in the back of the sanctuary during church services. When there’s a lull in action, however brief, smartphones appear, and eyes are toward them.But why must we check them so often? Is it because smartphones are such great tools for human flourishing or because they are evil taskmasters that make us less human with each use?This is the dilemma with which Tony Reinke opens his book, and if you’re like most people, the dilemma isn’t theoretical. Your phone is changing you. It’s certainly changing me. How could it be otherwise when we apparently check our smartphones every 4.3 minutes of our waking lives (p. 16)?Reinke is the author of several books, as well as the host of the popular Ask Pastor John podcast and a senior staff writer for Desiring God. He’s well suited to write this book for at least two reasons. First, Reinke feels the tension between the blessings and curses of technology more acutely than most. As a professional producer of online content, he must navigate reaching readers without succumbing to the click-bait, Buzzfeed-type posts that dominate web culture (to which, by the way, DG doesn’t capitulate).Second, Reinke is the perfect person to shine the glare from our screens back into our eyes, not only because he is a competent researcher and a nimble wordsmith, but because he is also a God-centered theologian. And this trait is necessary because, as he points out, “conversations about our smartphones often do not raise new questions; they return us to perennial questions every generation has been forced to ask” (p. 24). And it’s this point about how new technology always brings us back to the perennial questions—questions about what it means to be creature not Creator; about beauty vs. efficiency; about loving God and neighbor—which makes this book so insightful.Consider for just a moment our longing for approval (covered especially in chapters 3 and 6). Each generation must wrestle with this. The lore of Narcissus in Greek mythology, who fell in love with his own reflection, certainly predates the 2004 birth of Facebook. Today, perhaps, there are just more metrics to measure our beauty (likes, retweets, followers, pins, subscribers, and so on). And if you let it, your smartphone will send you push notifications for each of these so that when you wake up in the morning, you can glance at your phone to find out how many others love your face too. “When we talk about ‘smartphone addiction,’” writes Reinke, “often what we are talking about is the addiction of looking at ourselves” (p. 110).If there were something to critique about the book, maybe it would be the structure. The title and layout of the book (12 Ways . . .) could make the book seem like one giant list-article, or listicle as they’re called. Listicles tend to be the lowest common denominator of online content. I say this, by the way, as the author of several listicles. But this criticism, in my opinion, doesn’t hold. The depth of Reinke’s insights and his biblical fidelity resist formulaic chapters.One final comment. I found the book disturbing. But not because the problems created by smartphones are merely “out there” in culture or even in the church. Rather, I’m disturbed because the problems are “in here.” Despite all the blessings of smartphones (connection to others, wealth of information, and Bible apps galore), I still see the negative impact in my heart and habits. Too often my children compete with a screen for their dad’s attention. Being confronted with this change was disturbing . . . but it’s the good kind of confrontation, the kind that when paired with repentance of sin and faith in the gospel, leads to the good kind of change.\n","id":"1bf602dd-1cc6-4b81-b4f9-f1f668ce29b7"},{"text":"\n  This book was very eye opening and I have learned so much!

Our advances in technology have a way of rendering God more and more irrelevant to our world and in our lives—the very definition of worldliness. And if our digital technology becomes our god—our wand of power—it will inevitably shape us into technicians who gain mastery over a dead world of conveniences. Aimlessly flicking through feeds and images for hours, we feel that we are in control of our devices, when we are really puppets being controlled by a lucrative industry” (Tony Reinke, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You, Crossway, 2017, pp. 192-193).“My phone is a window into the worthless and the worthy, the artificial and the authentic. Some days I feel as if my phone is a digital vampire, sucking away my time and my life” (p. 15).Review:Tony Reinke says in his book, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You: “It is difficult to serve God with our heart, soul, strength, and mind when we are diverted and distracted and multitasking everything. Historian Bruce Hindmarsh adds, ‘Our spiritual condition today is one of spiritual ADD’… Our battle against the encumbering distractions of this world especially the unnecessary distractions of our phones—is a heart war we can wage only if our affections are locked firmly on the glory of Christ” (Tony Reinke, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You, Crossway, 2017, pp. 47, 50).  This sums up the core issue in his book, as he details the advantages and the idolatrous perils of smartphones’ reach and overreach. His diagnostic questions provide a basis of making that distinction: “Do my smartphone habits expose an underlying addiction to untimely amusements? Do my smartphone habits reveal a compulsive desire to be seen and affirmed?...Do my smartphone habits preoccupy me with the pursuit of worldly success?...Do my smartphone habits build up Christians in my local church?...Do my smartphone habits disengage me from the needs of the neighbors God has placed right in front of me?” (p. 52). This is a vital book for everyone who wants to balance relevance in the world with God-first priorities. 5 starsM.L. Codman-Wilson, Ph.D., 6/8/2017Excerpts“Like Narcissus staring down into the water, enchanted with himself, we bend over our phones and what most quickly captures our attention is our own reflection: our replicated images, our tabulations of approval, and our accumulated ‘likes.’ Social media has become the new PR firm of the brand Self. And we check our feeds compulsively and find it nearly impossible to turn away from looking at— and loving— our ‘second self’” (Tony Reinke, 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You, Crossway, 2017, p. 109).“I surveyed 8,000 Christians about social media routines and more than half of the respondents (54 percent) admitted to checking their smartphones within minutes of waking. When asked whether they were more likely to check email or social media before or after spiritual disciplines on a typical morning, 73% said before. This reality is especially concerning if the morning is when we prepare our hearts spiritually for the day…Our phones are addictive and like addicts, we seek hits immediately in the morning, and yes there is an app for that…Behavioral scientists and psychologists offer statistical proof in study after study: the more addicted you are to your phone, the more prone you are to anxiety and depression and the less able you are to focus at work and sleep at night” (pp. 42-43).“Free porn access on a smartphone represents a spiritual epidemic of unprecedented gravity in the history of the church, costing a whole generation of young Christians their joy in Christ and corroding young souls by the acid of unchecked lust…Technology makes us think we can indulge in anonymous vices, even conceptually, without any future consequences. Anonymity is where sin flourishes and anonymity is the most pervasive lie of the digital age. The clicks of our finger tips reveal the dark motives of our heart, and every sin—every double tap and every click—will be accounted for” (pp. 133-135).\n","id":"7eb641a5-e845-4d5b-842f-a520c1934968"},{"text":"\n  Love this key keeper organizer.I got it  for my brother's birthday.

I've had to invest a small fortune in my teeth and have needed crowns and painful root canals all my adult life, and even one implant. I finally did a complete makeover a year ago that included veneers to bring order and consistency to my smile. I get compliments all the time over my teeth now, but the hidden side is that I live in constant fear of what I eat, not to break anything or develop complications from lodged food particles. If you were born with healthy beautiful teeth you are blessed indeed. Anyway, either way, it requires regular and thorough cleaning to maintain healthy teeth and gums. Oral health problems can lead to other severe health problems including heart disease! Who would have made that connection not long ago. Add to that the obscene amount you might need to give to your dentist when problems do need to be addressed and you have every incentive to maintain your teeth with the best practices and tools available. Personally, I floss religiously, use a Waterpik,  use a stainless steel tongue scraper twice daily and, of course brush after every meal. On that last factor, you have many choices as to what brush to use, which is why you're here right now trying to make a decision.I have owned and used every generation of Oral B Electric Toothbrush since they first came out and love them. Your conventional toothbrush can do a very thorough job provided you use it correctly and spend the required time. Human nature, as it is, often translates to putting the brush in your mouth, especially in a hurried morning or a fatigued evening as your mind wanders and you wind up satisfied that you \"brushed\" when the reality is the job was not thorough or complete creating a false sense of security. A good electric toothbrush has the advantage of being more thorough even when you're not paying attention to what you're doing. There has been no doubt that each generation of Oral B has made my teeth feel super clean, though each new generation tries to offer more enhancements, along with higher prices. When it looked like they couldn't go anywhere more with its design, they came out with bluetooth connectivity and a phone app!  That seemed like superficial fluff when I first saw it. Do you really need to use your phone to brush your teeth? It turns out, there are some serious benefits since it helps you to concentrate and focus for those 2 minutes on what you're doing. Sad state of affairs if we have trouble focusing for a whole two minutes. Sadly, that's the contemporary attention span deficit. This latest generation, The Genius, claims to incorporate AI with the app. The bluetooth somehow determines the position of the toothbrush in your hand/mouth and as you stay in a quadrant of your mouth the picture representation of that area of your teeth turns from blue to white and that's when its time to move on to another quadrant. If you brush without the app on, the brush handle itself generates a stutter step signal after 30 seconds indicating it's time to move on. It doesn't give that small pause with the app on for some reason but its all visual. How well does it work? Its a bit spotty and has a little trouble at times showing where you're brushing, so I give it a B- there.  The handle itself is a nice piece of industrial design . The back side is a grippy material and easy to hold. The front has the power button, and underneath it a smaller button that allows you to choose which mode you prefer. Below that are 5 icons representing the mode and includes gentle, whitening and tongue scraping. I subscribe to the gentle is better school of thought so keep it in gentle mode. Below that is an icon that lights up to indicate a bluetooth connection and below that is the battery strength indicator. At the top of the handle is a ring of led lighting whose color you can choose via the app. It's function is to indicate if you're pressing on your teeth too hard, in which case it lights up and the brush speed slows down. The brush head slides into the top above that ring and there is a small colored buffer ring  attached that can be used to color code which family member belongs to that brush head. The handle stands up on a small charging unit between uses.So how does it all come together, and how does it compare with its chief rival, Phillips Sonicare, which you might be cross shopping it with? In a word, the unit is Great. Its easy to hold and control in your hand. The mode choices are helpful and the pressure warning light is a great safety feature. The bluetooth and app still need some perfecting but sometimes work as desired. The AI claim isn't some mad intelligence living in the handle, but is evidently something that took X amount of users and their brushing techniques and incorporates it into the correct way to use the brush via the app. Personally, it's more Hype unless I'm missing something here. The Genius X is a powerful tool and the round brush head is small but substantial. My teeth are very sensitive. So I notice the power of the unit even in gentle mode. I might compare it to the feel of the old American Muscle cars. It feels powerful and does a thorough though slightly visceral cleaning. By comparison, the Phillips Sonicare DiamondClean approaches cleaning with a different approach. Sonic vibration. Besides the obvious food particles that need to be removed after a meal, the real threat to your teeth is when bacteria form a biofilm. Bacteria multiply faster than a toddler darting off after toy when you take your eye off them for an instant. That multiplication can form a thin film shoulder to shoulder, not unlike football players in a huddle or rugby players in a scrim, that quickly becomes hard to dislodge if allowed too much time to get established. The vibration of the Phillips is supposed to break up any film so the motion seems less aggressive than the Oral B. You use the handles differently, moving the Phillips less. The Phillips, using the car analogy, seems more like Ferrari with a more precise and highly tuned engine than the rumbling rawness of a muscle car. Do they both clean equally well? Yes, I think so. I have and use them both. I tend to favor the Oral B when my teeth seem in need of a deeper more aggressive cleaning, maybe if I missed a brushing that day already. The Phillips is a a finer feeling tool maybe better if you never miss a cleaning. I love the gentle vibration and feel it might be aiding my gums also perhaps increasing blood flow just a bit. Also the model I have comes with a glass rinsing cup that doubles as the holder and wireless recharging method. That's pure genius! I asked my dentist just the other day about his thought regarding the two. He said that most of his patients prefer the Oral B though he himself uses the Phillips Diamond Clean. One thing I will point out, regarding the selection of this Genius X offering, is that for some weird reason at the time of this review, the \"Limited\" version is 199 dollars. Yet, the \"10000\" model is currently 50 dollars less, comes with 2 heads not just one and the case allows you to charge the brush when stored. Unless I'm missing something, you're getting more for much less. So scan the offerings listed before you click a purchase.Forgive me if my review was too wordy. In conclusion, I can highly recommend this new Genius X Oral B brush assembly. It's not cheap and a less expensive iteration of almost any Oral B brush might do a similarly thorough cleaning job for half this price, though without some of the bells and whistles. My final words, without sounding preachy, as someone who knows the tremendous monetary expense and excruciating physical pain dental procedures often involve, is to get a quality electric toothbrush and use it daily. In addition, make flossing at least once a day part of your oral care routine. Its absolutely worth the time and expense!\n","id":"43d18e69-3039-40fd-9e2e-6320baa60cf3"},{"text":"\n   Buyers beware!

Just be careful when you first  stick the 3M tape to make sure that it is in the position. I positioned and measured many times before installing the 3M tape permanently. Make sure that when you try the position, please the phone both in the proper position and also 90°, because you have to turn the phone 90° in order to lock. Make sure that you do this before fixing the 3M tape permanently, otherwise you may find that you cannot turn the phone  phone once installed. I would assume that if you have to peel the tape off, it is not as secure as before. I have used it for approximately two months in both Road and mountain bike conditions, even with rocky terrain, the phone is 100% secure.\n","id":"112673bf-9bac-4ef9-9b3b-f0797c0bf0d8"},{"text":"\n  It works extremely well and is very secure, but there are several steps one must take to make sure one has a happy experience with this product.  First of all I bought a TORRAS Slim Fit Hard Plastic Phone Cover Case. It provides a smooth and sturdy surface to which attach the adapter.  Second I had to make sure that my phone clears the handlebar when it is turned to release. I also wanted to make sure that my phone is pointing straight when it is locked into position.  Since you only have one chance to attach the adapter to phone case, little preparation helps.  I made a template out of cardboard that has the same width as my phone case.  The template a hole in a middle for attaching the adapter.  The template can be attached to the phone case with a couple of rubber bands or zip ties.  The critical point is that the template protrude from the bottom of phone case by a distance equal to a distance from the axis of rotation to the lower corner of the case minus the distance from the axis of rotation to the lower edge of the case, plus few millimeters (1/4 inch) for extra clearance.  Once the template is attached to the phone case, lock adapter into Garmin bracket and remove adhesive cover.  Attach phone case to the adhesive tape making sure that the bottom of template is flush with handlebar.  I then tightened a c-clamp  making sure it is centered on Garmin bracket and left it overnight.  It works like a charm now.\n","id":"c9c69409-45f4-4823-8801-88bfdda78df9"},{"text":"\n  Love the Kom bike mount for my Garmin Edge Explore, but the adhesive stick-on Universal Phone Adapter doesn’t stick.  I have gone through three in two months, all using different “flat” back cases for my iPhone X.  Today, my phone fell off the sticky back while I rode across a wooden bridge on a rail trail.  The vibration was too much, my iPhone fell to the ground at 20mph.  If not for my LifeProof case my phone would be wrecked.  The LifeProof case is a little mangled.  I blame this mount.  The other two Kom adhesive mounts I used fell off while I was not riding, just weak.  The plate itself is great.  I’d recommend ditching the adhesive and adding a silicone rubber band to this Kom plate.  Also, this mount negates wireless charging, hence why my recommendation that a silicone rubber band added to this mount would be better.  I’d be happy to test that if created.\n","id":"be108181-7efe-4eb8-bc73-33f709b070a5"},{"text":"\n  Fitment into a Barfly 4 mount is good, engagement and hold feel spot-on.

They are on a totally different level when it comes to price and durability. Even though this 11\" arm was able to take the weight of my Canon 5D IV with a canon 24-70mm f2.8 lens, I don't recommend it for something this heavy. Instead, this would be perfect if you want to mount a light camera, cell phone, or a reflector for product photography.The arm has the same mechanism concept of the Manfrotto arm, but in a smaller package. The only thing I saw different is the center joint has teeth on this 11\" arm, while the Manfrotto arm does not have any teeth.I also really like the jaw that comes with it. It feels very sturdy ESPECIALLY with this price point!I highly recommend it for light weight equipment.\n","id":"e0eced98-305e-4457-ae25-9252f19b777a"},{"text":"\n  TL;DR lightweight, sturdy mount, surpasses expectations, great value. Recommended!My initial impression when I received this mounting arm was that I would have to make due with it for the time being, and then get something else later on when I was willing to sink more money into a permanent investment. Everything is so small and light that I doubted it would be strong or rigid enough, and I didn't see a way to tighten the ball joints at the ends of each arm.I assumed that I would have to be very careful with it, that everything would be delicately balanced and any little bump or nudge would move things about. I couldn't have been more wrong!Well, when you tighten the knob between the two arms not only are you locking the teeth in that joint together, but it extends a little push-rod in the center of the arms that prevents the ball joints from moving. That leaves everything locked and rigid.As to the overall strength, I can say that it's more than strong enough for my purposes. The parts are thin and lightweight, but everything is rigid (when fully tightened) and doesn't slip or bounce once set up. The clamps and phone holder work perfectly and there are mounting attachments for cameras as well.So yes, I would recommend this to others.My use case is probably fairly unique, but worth mentioning nonetheless. I'm using this arm to mount a phone to a drawing board, such that I can view a piece of paper or small canvas through the camera and then using an app called 'artist's eye' to display a transparent photo which allows me to trace proportions from the photo onto the paper.This arm works perfectly for that, no wiggle or sagging (which would throw off the drawing).I can  also mount my pico projector to project onto a canvas for a similar purpose, and this mount could also be used for recording a drawing/painting process (for aspiring/practicing YouTube or Instagram artists).So no, I am not in the market for a new mount at this time. The only fact that may necessitate any new/additional hardware is that I can only get and area about 5\" x 8\" for my tracing. That's enough for now, and I have other suitable (albeit less convenient) solutions for larger images.\n","id":"c966d86f-3ac7-421c-9901-88acaaeba81c"},{"text":"\n  As a YouTube content creator, I was looking for a way to mount my Sony a6300 in my car so that I can do vlogging when wind or outside noise is too loud.  I stumbled upon this friction joined arm gadget on Amazon and purchased to see if it would work since it wouldn't break the bank.  I wasn't ready to commit to buying something super expensive since I don't believe I would be using this all the time.  I needed something small, affordable and something that I can stow away in the car such as under the seat.This comes in a small box and have multiple adapters. it even have adapters for gopros/action cameras.  The clamp is really easy to put work with as you would loosen the main knob in the center to adjust the articulation arms and control the ends.  the clamp is relatively strong; however, the clamp have rubber grips that seems to have glue that might be a bit weak. I used this gadget with my sony a6300 and i have noticed the rubber grips sliding a bit off when clamped on a pole. Note that i was testing indoors as depicted in the photos provided.  The AC was on and the house was approximately 70 degrees F.  now if i were to use this in the car or leave this in the car, i am not sure how soft the glue will become, but since nothing happen yet, I will say that so far this is as expected with a budget friendly tool.I am excited to see what creativity videos i can produce now that I have a way to mount my camera inside my car.

We had to explain that it’s not voice activated. He can take photos, listen to music that we allow on the device, play a few games and the educational apps are fun and hold his attention.For the price of $99, he now has his own device and responsible for charging it, taking care of it and knowing where he leaves it. No more dropping our expensive phones, hunting the house for our phones, or swiping away our messages and calls.For comparison, our iPhone XS Max measures 6.20 x 3.05 x 0.30 in and weighs 7.34 oz. while the Vtech device measures 7 x 3.8 x 0.80 inches and weighs 13.4 oz. The Vtech device is bigger and weighs more, however it’s just slightly smaller than an iPad mini. Although it looks like a phone, it’s not a phone, it’s a WiFi device similar to a WiFi iPad.Overall, we are completely delighted! We loaded the phone with educational apps for math and reading as well as a few creativity apps.\n","id":"d570885a-be8e-4585-8d18-fc67d2f54ca9"},{"text":"\n  As several have indicated, the VTech KidiBuzz G2 is larger than a standard phone, which is fine (depending on your expectations.  It has all the cues of a phone - rectangular, with a stylized border, and a swivel-able camera at the the top of the screen - which is what my little guy wanted.The screen has a \"washed\" quality, and as you interact with the camera, the processor, and inspect the \"tech specs\" of the device, it becomes clear that what the company has done here is to take either previous generation components or inferior components and products a product meant to provide a \"smart device\" like experience to children.  (To be fair, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It makes sense.  But it also makes pricing the device properly a difficult exercise.)As I mentioned, the screen has \"washed\" quality to it, the processor is slow, it only has 8gbs onboard and the camera requires \"absolute stillness!\" to produce a decent image.Those are the cons.  The pros include a thoughtful library of games and utilities, a \"talk to you\" function that acts as a bridge for children who aren't yet reading at velocity, and a super cool option of \"text mom and dad.\"I'm super judgmental.  I see all the deficits.  My son is absolutely OVER THE MOON about this thing.  He LOVES it, so I'm like \"hey...you like it?  I like it.  Period.\"At $100, like that red and white circular logo-ed place wants to get for this thing if you buy it in store, I'm not sure this is properly valued.  The device is likely \"worth\" somewhere between 50 and 70, and at $100 the entire paid library should be included for the life of the device.So in summary, I'm like \"meh\" (with a question mark) and my little guy is like \"whoa!\" and that equals three stars.\n","id":"d7ef7099-37e3-473b-842b-de0e0b2c7317"},{"text":"\n   Okay Ok , so I was a little skeptical when I got this phone mount . I wasn't fully sure if it was going to work. From taking it out of the box, I was a little skeptical. Anyhow, I read the directions, then put it on my mountain bike, which isn't really the bike it will be on. I then put my phone in which is a S8+. Once I stretched this  holder a bit, it was able to SECURELY hold my phone, with it's case. YES with the case. impressed I was.I really wasn't sure if this would have worked like I would have wanted it to . I then later went riding with the holder, and my phone mounted in it. Wow it held like a champ.

If your priority when buying a mount is how securely your phone rests in the mount itself then I suggest you buy this one. I've owned this for several months now; in fact I'm on my second unit because I misplaced the first. I have decided to write this review many months after purchase because this morning I was in a small accident on my bike. After I was able to get my bearings, I found my phone securely in the mount and still firmly attached to my handlebar. This was a pleasant surprise as I had a recently purchased phone in the mount and having it shatter would have been insult to injury. You can rest assured your device will be safe in this. For reference, the device I had in the mount was a Pixel 3 XL, which is about the same size as an iPhone XS Max or Note device.\n","id":"459d2fc6-e18e-46a2-8baf-012363018158"},{"text":"\n  This is mounted on a road bike, and holding a Nexus 6p with a case.  A fairly large phone, made a little larger by the case, the holder takes some stretching, but grips it firmly.  I have no concerns about the phone falling out.  I've done 3 road rides over occasionally bumpy terrain, and the phone stays in place well, and the holder grips the handle bars well enough that it does not rotate.  For the 6p, the spaces between the bands do not cover the fingerprint reader, power button or the charging port, so it works quite well.I have only used this in portrait mode, attached the the handlebars, not landscape mode, mounted on the stem.I have not had this mountain biking.  While I do not think there is any chance of the phone coming loose (except in a crash), the extra vibration might cause it to rotate on the bars.UPDATE:  I dit ride over some very bumpy road with my road bike, and the phone did indeed rotate forward, but I was able to to right it again easily.  I still do not think there is any danger of hte phone falling out.I have thought about the reviews where purchasers had the reteining straps break, and I wonder if they might have nicked them with a fingernail, or something similar.  My experience with silicone robber is that it can be quite durable, but if the surface is split at all, it can tear pretty easily.\n","id":"f66abcc2-5f91-4e2c-a0df-fc357ca3c219"},{"text":"\n  I have a Bianchi bicycle from 1994 that has thin handlebars. The product wrapped around perfectly and held the phone in place during a 100 mile ride.  Since the mount is made of silicone and cut slim, there were no screws that could loosen up, the mount did not slide, and I had plenty of room for my hands.  This holder replaced a plastic holder that used to move especially over railroad tracks, potholes and minor bumps in the road.  When the plastic cracked, I replaced it with this one which was referred to me by a bicycle article I found on the internet.  The product was packaged well and received on time.Note: This mount can also hold most external USB battery packs which I use to charge my light and my phone on very long rides.Steve, President of Central Jersey Bicycle Club\n","id":"16f7011b-e567-4612-aed9-84f38212ec74"},{"text":"\n  I have a Samsung S5 with Otter Box cover that I use for a GPS and for making tracks. I tried the medium phone mount but it was barely too small.  I had to return that no problem, and got the larger mount which fit great.  It is tight in the holder and stays put.  I rode 15mi of washboard and whoops and the device didn't move.  The holder is also low profile so in the event of a crash, the phone is lower than the grips so there is a good chance the phone won't make impact on the ground.  I definitely recommend this holder for off-road applications.\n","id":"84320c08-3fb8-4a81-963c-f18de18480ae"},{"text":"\n  So let me start off by saying I have been following this project on youtube, every step of the way, since the beginning... and after all the hype, I have been really excited to finally get one of my own!Unfortunately, I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. If I'm being honest, it does not feel very high-quality pulling it out of the box. At least not $99 worth. It is way lighter and less sturdy than I was expecting. You can feel lots of play in between each of the moving parts, and the magnets are very weak, I can barely tell they are there when trying to close the legs together. For a moment I was wondering if I got some sort of counterfeit product because I didn't order from their website.Don't get me wrong, I love the people behind this project and I absolutely love the concept... it just feels like it still needs quite a bit of refinement. This thing feels like it's a prototype.\n","id":"6e0976a3-1c02-4fdd-a13b-92a081fcb429"},{"text":"\n  With this product being made by youtubers, I thought it would be better. There is not ball mechanism to point it in the right direction. I like the overall design, it gets the camera far enough away from your face to vlog properly, and it's easy to set up as a tripod. Unfortunately, without the ball mechanism, this wont be a proper tripod. I have to squat down if I want to be in the frame, for that reason, I wouldnt say this is worth 100$. If you are only using this for vlogging and dont need it to be a functional tripod, this is a great buy. But if you want best of both worlds, this is far from it. Hoping the design will improve in the future.\n","id":"542c0cc0-9603-4eee-acbe-b3b0d13ee401"},{"text":"\n  Beautifully designed product. Metal construction, with a very cool design that just uses gravity to open the legs of the tripod, yet is quickly convertible to one-handed operation for vlogging with a flick of the wrist. The tripod has little desk protectors built into the tripod stand that also prevent it from slipping on hard surfaces. I always think high quality when using the SwitchPod. I added a small ball-head and quick release adapter for my Canon M50, which allows me to use it to take product photos.\n","id":"f5954726-167e-45f4-b390-d04bb4d7495c"},{"text":"\n  I finally got my Switchpod, and I'm already in love with this thing.  I don't typically fawn over hardware or accessories, but this little gem is worth its weight in Gold.  Setup takes < 10 seconds.  It's perfectly balanced in your hand.  Whether you're using it as a grip on the go or selfie stick, it just feels so good and keeping a larger DSL steady is WAY easier than with a Gorilla Pod (my prior small pod / selfie handle).The only thing it needs is a Pan / Tilt head (which I hear is in the works) for when you set it down on an uneven surface.  Sign me up for first in line if it's built anything like this piece of art.When I saw this reviewed by Peter McKinnon I knew I had to have it.  He was so right about this.  1/2 the weight, 1/6th the size of a Gorilla Pod, fits in the side of my bag, ads virtually no noticeable weight and feels so good.Really, really well done.\n","id":"36387982-5657-47ea-ac6f-09c90b4d0661"},{"text":"\n  OK -- so I just got my SECOND Switchpod.  One is now a permanent fixture on my desk -- I use it for FB live video in my \"studio.\"  The other one stays in my bag when I am on the go.  My ONLY COMPLAINT is my 10 year-old daughter.  She keeps stealing the Switchpod to make her Tic Tok videos.  So looks like I will need a third.Seriously, the Switchpod is awesome because of outstanding ergonomics.  Apparently, one of the guys on the SwitchPod team was a design architect -- and it show.  This thing is beautiful.  But also incredibly functional (just like all great designs).  Guess that guy was paying attention in school.But also highly functional.  Unlike the competition, it's completely sturdy.  Super strong -- could probably use it to change a car tire (don't try this).  Easily holds big cameras -- Canon 5D mk4 and Sony A7r3 are no problem at all for this thing.  Well balanced and easy to use on the go.My prediction -- this will end up in the camera gadget HALL OF FAME.
