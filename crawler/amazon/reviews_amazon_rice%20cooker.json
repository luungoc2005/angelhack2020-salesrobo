[{"text":"\n  I had a small rice cooker already, but it didn't have the smart functions, so when I saw that this one was priced at $69, I had to get it.

I love how easy it is to measure the rice:water ratio with the dedicated measuring cup, the auto cook functions, and the timed cooking. Rice doesn't stick to the pot, and it's easy to clean.

Just search the term and you will get more than you'll want to read.However, all that being said, I went ahead and bought the gloves. They are a true fit (the palm measurement provided works) and they are flexible to work with. I've tested them a little bit with gripping my knives, which I sharpen after each use, and they seem to do the job. The only thing I can't advise here is if they save you with a big chop or rapid mandolin action. Should that accident happen, I'll add to this review.

It's a nice substantial weight and I like that it's white rather than the semi-transparent color of the steamer basket (which already looks a bit dirty).  However, theres barely any cooking instructions included and they few they include are vague and didn't work for me.  I consistently have found I need far more water than the instructions call for and often a full second cooking cycle in order to cook grains enough.  Also, food and water measurements are in (European) milliliters or grams.  Which is fine, I happened to have a kitchen scale and european measuring cups thanks to my Swedish husband.  My gripe is that I'd like to be able to use the babycook mixing bowl to measure water to add to the insert but the measurements printed on the bowl don't match those in the recipes. For instance, the recipes for rice and pasta calls for 120mL and 180mL, yet the mixing box has tick marks for 150 and 200mL.  The insert itself doesn't have any marks to help with measuring.  Small detail, but it's a design flaw that could have been improved in a few ways that would make using the product easier.

The sides were clean but the bottom and the filter still had heavy mineral buildup. This is to be expected, because the instructions are for routine MAINTENANCE cleanings, NOT for heavy mineral buildup from years of neglect. To get the heavy mineral buildup left behind, add one packet (it is citric acid powder) to a cup of warm water, stir well, then add ONLY three more cups of water and run the cleaning cycle. The citric acid in the water is too dilute otherwise. All the mineral buildup should be cleaned off.I read one of the reviews on this site and someone was worried about \"harsh chemicals\" being used. All this product is is citric Acid, it is completely safe; if you are worried about ANY citric acid residue, you would immediately notice a strong tart taste in the water if there were any citric acid left.\n","id":"7f405b63-94db-44d3-8991-550d0f83393d"},{"text":"\n  So glad that I read the reviews.

I had a terrible time with this cookware set on my camping trip and the ONLY good thing I can say about it is that it is compact and lightweight. If you are backpacking I can see how that would be important, but literally everything else about this set is terrible. Here is a detailed breakdown:- NOT non-stick. Everything I cooked stuck horribly to this and was a terrible sticky mess to scrape out of the pans. It did not matter how much oil I used. I cooked burgers in the pan and they were ruined because they were totally stuck to the pan when I tried to flip them. Eggs would stick terribly. Everything sticks terribly to these. Save yourself the trouble and get a good teflon pan or two, or cast iron if you are car camping and don't care about the heft. My wife and I spent half an hour after every dinner scrubbing away at these horrible pans; it was a huge chore and I regretted not bringing a normal pan or two.- Cookware is thin and does not transfer heat evenly. The pans are basically paper-thin and as such have horrible hot spots that will cause you to burn parts of your dish.- \"Frying pan\" is too small to cook any decent amount of food and has very steep vertical sides, making it basically impossible to get a spatula in there to flip things over. But it doesn't really matter since everything you try to cook will be welded to the bottom of the pan long before that even becomes an issue.- The flip out handles are a nightmare in practice and get very hot since they are close to the side of the pan. They don't latch together or anything, so they are flopping about when trying to move the pan around. Potentially dangerous since it could result in you spilling a pot full of boiling liquid on yourself when the handles flop about.  Again, bring a few normal pots and pans unless you absolutely must have an ultra-compact cookware set for backpacking.- The plates and bowls are a joke. See photo of them next to an average sized dinner plate. They are flimsy cheap plastic and the plate holds enough food for a child, but not for an adult unless sloppily overloaded. The bowls are uselessly small; they hold about 1/2 cup of liquid. We ended up eating out of the pots directly if we wanted something like soup, since the bowls were way too small to be useful.In summary, this was a very frustrating set to use due to the small size of everything and the complete failure of the non-stick surface, and I'll be returning it. Do not consider this unless you are extremely size/weight constrained. If you are car camping, just bring some normal pots and pans and some plastic plates and bowls, and save yourself the trouble.\n","id":"3fd86616-0771-49fe-9f9a-8ba61569a43f"},{"text":"\n  I purchased this set and another, almost identical set from another manufacturer for the same price in order to compare them side by side. Both sets included almost identical products, similar bags, etc. the differences being minor details. This set was advertised as having 7 large plates, 7 small plates and 6 bowls (all lightweight, BPA-free plastic). The other set came instead with 6 plates, 6 sets of silverware ( knife, fork, spoon) and 6 8-ounce glasses (all stainless steel, cups have silicon sleeves).  The good:  This set was lighter weight by 2 1/2 pounds.  The lids on this set are superior in design and construction compared to the other set, as is the much more robust and sturdy bracket which holds the handle to the biggest (4l) pan. The kettle in this set is larger, holding approximately one cup more liquid. The bag on this set is also of superior quality and construction.  The not so good: This set DID NOT include 7 each of the large and small plates, rather it is 7 total, 3 large (9inch) and 4 small (8 inch) plates.

Now he has no computer to do his homework with. I plugged it in and all the circuits on my equipment were immediately fried.

It came wired for UK AC power. Rather than send it back and get one for US AC power, I decided to try a transformer.After much research, I selected the Goldsource ST-1000 Pro.  I chose it because it is simple with only an on/off switch to operate it.  To use it as a step up transformer simply connect a 110/120 V US AC source to the 100/120v input. The front side provides a universal output and a schuko output.  The universal output will accept a US type B plug.The transformer is silent/transparent and in my opinion may offer another level of isolation/protection for the subwoofer.\n","id":"35429578-a8bb-41c1-8fa9-9bbd35b60a69"},{"text":"\n  This is such a wonderful cookbook.

This book first suggests‚Äîthen proves through chapters divided by different uses and different styles of donabe‚Äîthat a donabe can be used for many types of dishes.  You will find recipes for rice dishes; steamed vegetables and meats; roasted and fried fish, chicken, pork, tofu, and more; smoked meats, seafood, cheese, vegetables; besides the more well-known hot pots, soups and stews.This is a lovely compilation of Japanese recipes:  Rich, warming, exciting and varied in flavors.  If you are at all interested in Japanese foods and cooking, this is a book you need to work through.  Plus, it has an entire chapter at the end, which gives recipes for dashi, sauces and condiments.It should be noted one of the authors of this book, Naoko Takei Moore, is the owner of Toiro Kitchen, a big seller of donabe cookware in the US.  A good move on her part?  Maybe.  Her website has many styles and pieces of cookware offered for sale.  And quality donabe from the Iga Provence of Japan is not inexpensive.Also on her store website are a LOT of donabe recipes.  I have checked, and except for the basic rice cooking instructions, the 104 recipes on the website do not really overlap those in this book.  Some come close, but they are different.  You might want to take a look at those recipes, because they will give you a feel for those in this book.  And be sure to check out the \"Look Inside\" feature on this product page.  Ten Speed Press always does such a great job with this feature.A real donabe is not mandatory to make good use of this cookbook:  I have been wanting to buy a quality donabe for several years now, and this book has helped me with my decision-making.  The info in this book has also convinced me that my choice to NOT buy an inexpensive donabe from the oriental market was a good one.  In the meantime, I have learned that I can get decent results‚Äînot perfect, but not bad‚Äîfrom regular pots on the stovetop and my electric rice cooker.  I even use a huge vintage electric fondue pot from the 70‚Äôs with good results.Before introducing recipes, this book will clue you in on how to care for and season donabe, and dos and don‚Äôts for handling donabe while cooking.  It is a very helpful abundance of info.There are many vegetarian and vegan recipes included, and they are marked as such.  There are also options provided to turn regular dishes into vegan dishes.  You will also find suggestions to create a shime course (finishing course) from the remaining broth.  I find some of the shime suggestions to be great recipes in their own right, and suitable for a separate meal.Beautiful photographs of prepared dishes, envy-provoking donabe pots, action photos, scenery.Substitutions are offered in many instances:  Dijon for Japanese mustard, green onions for negi, mushroom and miso options, and more.  Pantry ingredients are not hard to find if you‚Äôve got an oriental market nearby.  If not, Amazon has it all.There are pictures of each dish, sometimes the pre-assembled ingredients, sometimes the ingredients in the pot, sometimes its shime course.The first chapter is a compilation of hot pots using quite a variety of main and accompanying ingredients:  Tofu, beef, pork, fish, oysters, duck, mushrooms, cabbage, gyoza (dumplings), even Korean kimchi, and more.  I loved the ‚ÄúChicken Meatballs in Hot Sesame Miso Broth‚Äù, a two-column list of ingredients, but ingredients that I can find easily at an oriental market or are usually on my pantry shelves.In the next chapter are rice dishes cooked in a donabe double-lidded rice cooker, and it is one revelation after another.  There are several recipes that I will recreate again and again, but my favorite is a small red snapper, just gutted, cleaned and scaled, placed in the pot along with the rice and dashi, ginger, king mushrooms and a few other ingredients.  I also love the ‚ÄúJuicy (boneless) Chicken-Wing Rice‚Äù.Love the chapter on soups, stews and braises:  Everything from dried soybeans;  simmered vegetables in dashi and sake, mirin and brown sugar; braised sweet and spicy kabocha; to salt-marinated 1 pound hunks of pork shoulder; miso Keema curry (Indian curry with ground meat); simmered thin-sliced beef with noodles and potatoes; soy and sake flavored ground chicken and eggs over rice.  There is even a salmon chowder‚Äîand if you know chowders, you can adapt this recipe to just about any ingredient combination.There are also instructions for using a donabe for a sous vide technique, with a digital thermometer through the steam hole.The donabe can be used as a steamer:  The chapter includes combinations of vegetables, fish or seafood and vegetables and tofu, and sauces.  It provides a custard recipe.  There are rice balls, dumplings, and steamed cakes.In the chapter using a tagine-style donabe, I found recipes that might just ‚Äúforce‚Äù me to buy this specialty donabe, (although a lidded heavy skillet already on your kitchen shelf might work):  Roasted potatoes, steam-fried vegetables, steamed clams and vegetables, pork sukiyaki, crunchy lotus root in a vinegar sauce, and many more.There is a chapter on smoking, too.Dashi recipes, sauces and condiments are located at the back of the book, and you will find yourself referring to them often.Sometimes Japanese cookbooks are difficult to maneuver through, with so many foreign ingredients to understand and memorize.  Maybe that statement is only true for cooks with brains like mine, which struggle with foreign words.  But I had no trouble working my way through these recipes.  (I will still take the book with me to the market‚Ä¶.)  Plus there is a decent 8-page comprehensive and valuable glossary.There are two pages explaining important kitchen tools and a short resource page.*I received a temporary download of this book from the publisher.  I used it for several months, and when the book was finally published, I bought a hard copy‚Äîthat is how much I like it.\n","id":"800d9ad1-ec1a-45df-a0e0-bb9531b688a0"},{"text":"\n  I love this book and I'm learning so much from it.

It is truly a well built item that will last very long.As soon as I did the water test.  I realized that the handle area was leaking steam and would not stop leaking.After doing this test 3 times and getting consistent results.  I realized that the problem was caused by the Euromatic valve located inside the handle. part # 011-631-00-750I looked up images on the Fissler website for this valve.  The valve should have a round white plastic looking tip.The valve on my pressure cooker did not have this component.  It just had a square metallic end.course of action:1)  Research.  I went to the Williams Sonoma store in my neighborhood and looked at their Fissler pressure cookers only to discover that their valves were just like mine! (defective :-)).  Yep.2)  I emailed Fissler Usa.  Got no reply.  I then called them.  I spoke to a lady that told me that I would have to mail them the tiny valve.  They would then proceed to test it in the laboratory.  If in fact it was defective they would send me a new one.I told her that I had spent close to $300 and the valve is $14 retail.  Just send me the valve. . . She said no.So, finally I bit the bullet and bought the valve from the fissler website.  My Pressure Cooker works like a charm.  I plan on using it daily.  Made pulled pork using a pork shoulder and it was a great success.  The cleaning was a breeze.  This thing is a tank!Conclusion:  Buyer beware.  There must be a huge batch of these problematic valves in the US.  Fissler USA needs to realize that and fix it.  The actual product is fantastic though.\n","id":"aa557c17-c4a2-4d79-bc69-d89097690394"},{"text":"\n  Its very disappointing to find after more than a decade of folks complaining about the black top Euromatic valve failures and the fact that they have the solution, a white top valve as shown in their users manual, they are still selling pressure cookers with the old failing valve. If you go this route , be sure to add 20-25 dollars to the total invested in this cooker to buy  the new valve separately. I'll edit this review after the new valve comes in. As it stands it's a crap shoot if the VitaQuick 8.5 qt cooker will hold pressure. In the meantime it is a very nice saucier.EDIT:After spending the extra money to replace the Euromatic valve to the white top, this this pressurizes quick and even holds pressure better. Knowing this makes it a shame they still sell this with the old valve.  If you still have the old black top Euromatic and find yourself watching this PC steam out the handle for a few minutes before pressurizing, do yourself a favor get the whitetop valve.\n","id":"1844332c-e3a3-4313-b662-cb9c50697a7b"},{"text":"\n  30 years ago I was gifted a Hawkins aluminum wiggle-top pressure cooker.  After using it for about 10 years, until it warped, and until I became worried about cooking in aluminum, I upgraded to a Kuhn Rikon Duromatic 7L cooker.  The Duromatic has served us well for some 20 years, though I have always had issues with scorching at the edges, and it's a bit narrow for the amount of food that it can fit.  I was given an Instant Pot for my birthday.  After using the Kuhn Rikon, the Instant Pot was painfully slow to come up to pressure (30 minutes vs maybe 5 or 6 for the Kuhn Rikon), and scorched foods even more than the Kuhn Rikon.  It also decided that food was being burnt and turned off, so I ended up \"finishing\" the food in the Kuhn Rikon.  I don't understand all the fuss about Instant Pots, but on the bright side it means that there are a lot more pressure cooker recipes available (though I still rely on Lorna Sass for most methods). I returned the Instant Pot to the store, and renewed my interest in stovetop pressure cookers.  After reading the reviews of the Fissler by America's Test Kitchen, I decided to give it a try.  Why did I wait so long?!  I did a pressure test first thing (about 2L of water brought to high pressure for 5 minutes), and it worked like a dream.  Quite a bit of machine oil came off with that first trial, so I definitely recommend doing this as well as washing it before first use.  It's much wider than the Kuhn Rikon (about 10 inches versus about 8), and so it's easier to saute before starting to pressure cook.  The bottom is super-heavy and goes all the way to the edge.  Sauteeing is dream, as the heat is constant - more like a nice dutch oven than a regular pan.  It seemed to take slightly longer to reach high pressure than the Kunh Rikon (6 or 7 minutes for 2 cups of rice and 6 cups of liquid vs. maybe 5 for the Kuhn Rikon), which makes sense because it's a lot heavier.  Once it reached pressure, I turned the heat very low, and the pressure remained high - much less fiddling with the heat on my gas stove to keep the pressure even than with the Kuhn Rikon.  The first dish I made was a paella-flavored risotto - no scorching and it was completely perfect in exactly the time noted in Lorna Sass's recipes for risotto.  My husband then made a Korean stew with tofu and beef short ribs - the meat was falling off the bone after 20 minutes at pressure and a natural release.  Amazing!  I like the pressure release button - no more having to waste water cooling the cooker for a quick release, and no more mess.  The little \"hat\" that covers the well surrounding the pressure valve on the Kuhn Rikon fell off years ago, and so water collects in that well when cooling it with water, and then that water spills when taking the lid off.  There is no well on the top of the Fissler, so this would not be an issue, though I don't know why one would use water when the button works so well.  I wear steamproof oven mitts and put a dish towel over the pot to contain the steam when using the pressure-release button.  The pressure indicator is easy to see.  It's easy to clean, though it is really heavy so definitely use 2 hands to move it around.  I expect that it will serve well for another 20 years.  It appears that replacement parts are available, so I will replace the gasket and other rubber/plastic bits regularly.  I waited too long to do this with the Kuhn Rikon, and when I finally did, it made a large difference in performance of the pot.  The Fissler is a functional thing of beauty!  I highly recommend this pressure cooker.\n","id":"dada3467-003f-4294-8c33-47823220c195"},{"text":"\n  Defective.  Failed a 2 cup water test out of the box.

While the noodles were still good, you had to microwave them for at least 8-9 minutes and still they would have this weird taste to them. It wasn't until I was re stocking on noodles and other snacks that Amazon recommended me this little bowl that claimed it cooked your noodles in the microwave in 3 minutes and they would come out just like they would if they were made on a stove.It was cheap and so I decided to try it. OH MAN! This is the way to eat noodles. I had bought two packs of two bowls and ended up giving them to a few of my co-workers who now love these things. DEFINITELY A GREAT PURCHASE.

My older son laughed at me for buying such a gimmick and told me it was ridiculous to pay this price for a bowl.

On the back it said that to reduce sodium, use only half the spice packet. Duh.  WHY would they make a claim on the front that \"healthy cooking, reduces sodium\".  It is so misleading and leads a consumer to believe that the product itself reduces sodium.  I cannot believe they can get away with having that on the front of the package.

This is great for fellow college students that can't always precisely time or ration the exact amount of water to cook the ramen, or for those who only have a microwave. This makes cooking ramen packs sooo much easier and consistent.The only minor flaw is that since this is plastic, it will sometimes \"hold on\" to flavor/smell if you leave it in there too long, whether it's leaving it in the sink after you eat the ramen, or letting it soak in the dish detergent. You should wash this with minimal detergent right after, don't leave it laying around soaking up the smells.\n","id":"f8b89012-fc00-4c44-954f-151e624793f9"},{"text":"\n  Great heavy duty\n","id":"aba44605-2d3a-4771-a6a3-6005e26ef4d1"},{"text":"\n  The inner diameter of this connector is too large to hold a plug securely.

Well, I'm so glad I read that comment and the ones from other people who said they use one too,  because I'd never heard of a diffuser for my gas burners and this gadget has changed the way we cook on this gas stove top!I cannot compare this particular diffuser to any others because it's my first but for us, this one has worked great. The one thing I might wish was different is the finish on the top. It is smooth and with some of my pans it's easier for them to move around, so maybe a textured finish would be better but it's not like my pans are slipping off; that has not happened.The handle is removable (squeeze the two sides together to compress it and pull out of the hole, reverse to re-insert it into the hole when needed). I keep the handle in the drawer next to my stove because I leave the diffuser on my second hottest burn all the time. I actually want to buy a couple more but I'd like one bigger one for my hottest burner and I don't think this company makes a larger one. I'll check and if not will buy another brand for that one, but I do plan to get one more 7\" diffuser for one of my back (lower heat) burners. I don't use them much so I'll share one between them.Anyhow, this find allowed me to love our new stove now. The oven is great but I really thought the stove was never going to work out. This diffuser made the difference.\n","id":"83b46480-b408-4af1-b179-2cba8062ec5c"},{"text":"\n  I have had a Braun gas stove for a few years and have struggled to bring my pots down to simmer range since we use propane gas which tends to burn hot.  I had been using an old diffuser that had all the little holes in the metal disk that goes under the pot but still had to keep on stirring to make sure that food didn't stick.  I saw this diffuser while browsing through  amazon and decided to give it a try.  It worked perfectly: minimal stirring (only needed to when I mixed in additional seasoning), uniform heat distribution, and although it's cast iron it heated up quickly when the gas was on medium-low!!  It sits firmly on the gas ring.  The removable handle attaches and detaches easily which I love.  Being able to remove it means that it does not get in the way of larger bottomed pots which causes them to tilt.  I only had it a short time so felt unable to rate durability.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!  In my book it's a 5+ star product.\n","id":"5ca942ed-0ad4-40ae-b10c-31f81f24dcfa"},{"text":"\n  I got this for my electric range because it worked great on my mom's gas stove.

I'll attach some pictures so you can get a sense of how it looks with a standard gas burner.  Also, I realized after using it that I'd underestimated the value of it's feet, which keep it from sliding around on the burner when putting items on it. The third image is of the ring upside down so you can see it's low feet.  The more I use this reducer ring, the better I love it.

I have a lot of other Le Creuset pieces so I wasn‚Äôt sure I should get this (since I don‚Äôt eat a ton of rice)  but I‚Äôm glad I did.

The rice doesn‚Äôt stick like crazy like it does in other pots.  The interior lid does seems to keep the rice water from bubbling over while cooking which was the major selling point for me.  I‚Äôve been cooking more rice since I purchased this cutie and discovered that I prefer Jasmine rice to the extra long grained rice I‚Äôve been cooking for years so that‚Äôs an added bonus.  Also discovered (as a general rice cooking method) it‚Äôs best to rinse the rice before you cook it and I wasn‚Äôt doing that before either.

When I ordered them, I was looking forward to comparing the various varieties.  I lived in the Himalayan foothills for a while when growing up and learned to love rice there. Here is what I ordered:ÔÉò > Elvissmart Extra Long White Basmati Rice - Premium Aged, 10 LBS, Healthy GrainÔÉò > Elvissmart Premium White Basmati Extra Long-Grain Aromatic Rice Variety, Fluffy & Quick Cooking, 10 Pound BagÔÉò > Elvissmart Extra Long Basmati Rice, 10 Pound, AromaticÔÉò > Elvissmart Himalayan White Basmati Rice-Naturally Aged, Double Polished, 10 LBS BagThese were separate listings, different names, different prices. They have all arrived and I was disappointed to discover that all the bags of rice are labelled identically aside from the different product numbers.  40 pounds is a lot of rice! That is 428 servings in total according to the info on the bags. That would be fine since I love Basmati Rice but unfortunately this is not high-quality basmati.  While it is a pleasant long grain white rice, the ordinary 365 brand white Basmati that I get at Whole Foods is much longer grain and very much more aromatic.  This is not terrible rice, just not great.  I‚Äôm not even sure it is actually Basmati since it does not have the typical wonderful aroma of Basmati.I tried several methods of cooking the rice hoping to bring out the aroma And I tried cooking some of the rice from each bag.  By the way, the bags are very thin and rip easily so you will want to be prepared to transfer the rice to storage containers right away.  I used large glass canning jars.First, I used my usual absorption method and usual measures for cooking basmati and the result was too hard and dry, possibly because of the extra aging.  I added more water and cooked quite a bit longer and it was okay, though not aromatic, and not extra-long grain.Next, I tried the traditional Indian method which I have not used in a while. I cooked the rice like pasta in lots of water, then drained it through a fine strainer. This worked great although I did have to boil it for 15 minutes (which is much longer than expected) to get the right texture. Very fluffy results though not aromatic and not extra-long grain. ***  This is the method that I recommend. ***Lastly, I tried soaking the dry rice overnight in lots of water and then draining it and cooking it using the pasta method.  It was fine but no better than skipping the soaking. It did cut the actual cooking time in half.I had forgotten how convenient the pasta method can be for cooking rice: No need to rinse the dry rice since you are using lots of water. No need to measure carefully since you will strain off the copious extra water at the end. Easy to clean cooking pot. And nice fluffy results.\n","id":"b9c3058e-9211-490d-b869-0b266ba6f240"},{"text":"\n  Summary: This long grain rice is aromatic and flavorful. It cooks up soft and fluffy, and can be reliably cooked to form a crispy ‚Äútahdig‚Äù or ‚Äúsocarrat‚Äù layer.My experience: First, let me say that i bought more of this delicious rice! I didnt look closely at the labels in their listings, and i thought i was buying slightly different varieties, because the listings changed the wording a little. So several of my reviews are the same, because it‚Äôs the same rice!I never knew rice can be a satisfying main dish until friends cooked some basmati rice and created a crispy but still light ‚Äútahdig‚Äù layer under it. This basmati is as fragrant and flavorful as that, and i have been able to consistently cook delicious dishes by soaking this rice, then boiling, then simmering while the water evaporates, and learning how fast each pan and stoves cooks. You want to control the last few minutes carefully if you want a perfect layer of crisp tahdig or soccarat, and this rice can do it because the rice is well screened to give consistent results. Until you do that, you wont know how precious and delicious each long grain of basmati rice can be. My photo? Dont worry. I ate that last grain, too!My friends told me a secret to creating a tahdig layer, and they said they prefer long grain basmati, instead of this extra long grain. Because they are experienced, the technique they showed me worked perfectly with this rice! But they asked me to say that, if you are not used to cooking with ‚Äúextra‚Äù long grain rice, you will have to modify your usual soaking time and cooking time and even the amount of water. And the pan matters! And the stove! I have new respect for those who cook a perfect tahdig or socarrat every time.5 stars for great tasting, aromatic, evenly sized, unbroken grains. So i bought more than i intended? No regrets! I love this and will be sharing with friends and family!\n","id":"a6fce41f-9042-4c3a-97ae-88acf2d12211"},{"text":"\n  My mother and I don‚Äôt eat much rice, but I‚Äôve heard such wonderful things about basmati rice so I had to try it.This is a HUGE bag and will likely last us a VERY long time.One HUGE issue ‚Äì as I was trying to stand it up to open it, the bag split clear down the side on the counter and I lost about 1-2 pounds of rice (I saved about 8 pounds).

So I guess I get to do the actual experimentation, which isn't what I expect from something I paid money for.

I actually made 2 cups of rice to 4 cups of water and it came out so much rice! It was to the top of my 3 quart pot. I put turmeric in it and some fresh parsley, butter and a little low sodium salt. And it was perfect! I did follow the directions and I soaked the rice and rinsed it really well. I cooked as directed. So I'll be using this until it's gone and I may order some more. The grains are really long when it's fully cooked. Next time I'll make less rice. I didn't know what to expect and is why I made what I did. I didn't know it was going to blow up that big in the pot. It's REAL BIG! So definitely less next time. Highly recommend if you don't mind soaking and rinsing your rice. Some people just want to cook it and get it over with.

When water starts boiling and steaming again, cover pot with tight fitting lid, reduce heat to just above it's lowest setting, and let rice cook for 15 minutes undisturbed.After 15 minutes, remove pot from heat, with lid still on (no peeking!); let rice steam another 5 minutes.Uncover rice, fluff it up with a fork.Fun with Tumeric:To add a bit of color, mix ‚Öõ teaspoon turmeric with a tablespoon of water, then add a handful of some still hot rice to the mixture. Then mix this rice back into the white rice.RICE Comparison:‚ÜíJasmine Rice (sticky)Jasmine rice is originally from Thailand and commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking. This is a long grain variety of rice that has a subtle floral aroma and a soft, sticky texture when cooked. The grains are also shorter and thicker than basmati rice.Before cooking it's important to wash all types of rice to remove dust and excess starch. Jasmine rice is traditionally cooked by steaming or using the absorption method, which simply means it's cooked in a measured amount of water which is completely absorbed by the rice.‚ÜíBasmati Rice (non-sticky)Basmati rice hails from the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India and Pakistan. There are some varieties grown in the U.S., but they aren't quite as good as the imported varieties. This is a long grain variety of rice commonly used in Indian, Middle Eastern and Persian cooking. Basmati rice is commonly available at most grocery stores and is available in both white and brown varieties.Basmati rice needs to be soaked for at least 30 minutes before cooking. This allows the grains to absorb water and cook evenly without breaking. Basmati rice is traditionally cooked by boiling it in water.‚ÜíTexmati rice is grown in Texas, and is a cross between Basmati and Texas long grain rice. We prefer Basmati over Texmati. To my taste, Texmati is missing length, fluffiness, aroma, and flavor compared to... okay... Texmati sucks compared to India Basmati. Although Jasmine is similar to Basmati and pretty good in it's own right, Basmati is a hard act to follow.‚ÜíSo... rinse and repeat to give either rice a thorough washing (carful not to break the grains... easy does it), then soak for at least 30 minutes to prepare it for cooking. Skipping either step will result in an end product that will surely disappoint. These fancier rices are a far cry from Minute Rice, and the other common, everyday rices most American's are used to. They require a lil' extra effort and care to prepare, but the end result is oh so worth it.I hope this helps.\n","id":"b58ad23d-33e6-49f4-9196-0260f70fce63"},{"text":"\n  I usually buy basmati rice in large sacks at the local Asian market but wanted to avoid a trip and ordeered this rice to try. I was also operating under the false information that basmati rice from India is less likely to contain arsenic than rice grown in the United States and it turns out this is a PR campaign from the Indian government that does no testing of its rice and simply claims that no rice with arsenic is ever exported.I now realize as well that most of the basmati rice from India is from a genetically modified strain and this GM rice is more likely to cause intestinal upsets and is possibly carcingenic. So no reduction in arsenic and a dangerous lab modified genetic structure has led me to buying rice being grown in Thailand. The Thai rice is better tasting as well as much healthier to consume.\n","id":"acc09c4d-6e01-47fa-b8df-d67dab7f606f"},{"text":"\n  I have a steamer/rice cooker.

Although I do not know a bit about japanese words since all of the instructions are in japanese (no english translation), I just made the directions based on my assumptions on the pictures that the box shows so I am not sure if it is as accurate but its better than nothing. Do not bash me if I am wrong, used this as tips or advice. Do your own trial and error on your type of rice you are cooking.Directions1. The first step just seem to be telling you how much rice you want to cook or prepare like between 0.5-2 cups of rice (minimum and maximum amount you can make I assumed).2. Second step as most likely any asian would do is the washing and rinsing step. As the pictures shows, you wash the rice then pour and strain the water to remove most of the starch in the rice.3. I think the third part is putting in the amount of water needed for the rice to be cooked, I recommending adding a half a cup more or 1 more cup (preferably for sushi rice or softness). CC as I believed could stand for cubic centimeters so try converting that to ml. Do your math.2 cup=420cc (approx. 2 cups)1 cup=220cc (approx. 1 cup)0.5 cup=120cc (approx. 1/2 cup)4. The fourth part consist of how long you cook the rice in the microwave. Every rice varies so make your own assumptions.2 cup=13 mins (15 mins is ok but will be very hot on the container)1 cup=9-10 mins0.5 cup=7-8 mins5. After it is finished and you  take it out of microwave. Let stand for 15 mins to cool down.Like I said used this as a tip or reference. Trial and error with your own rice or food. White rice, brown rice, vegetables, quinoa, stew or etc...base it off by your own assumptions. Since it is from japan, I believe this would mostly work for white rice more.

Such considerations include its operational know how and the appropriate way to use it. The instant pot is a little but powerful equipment in the kitchen. It is a combination of functions in one. In the instant pot, you have yourself a yogurt maker, slow cooker, and rice cooker. The instant pot works with pressure manipulation and this is why you are able to get boiling water at a different boiling point without altitude change. The steam generated at this changed boiling point is sealed in and this raises the boiling point. This was initially designed for hikers who need to cook on mountain peaks but has found great use in the kitchen of your home due to the advantages it offers which include time efficiency and enhanced flavor. There are so many advantages the instant pot has over other pressure cookers which include a stainless inner cooking pot and other features such as a handled trivet which lay to rest your worry about handling hot pots.‚Äô She proceeds to instruct us about the various buttons on the pot and which ones to select for various food types and how to manipulate them for success.Then come the recipes ‚Äì each with time required to make the recipe, the servings, ingredients, excellent instructions, and finally the nutrition values of that dish (calories, fat, carbs, fiber, protein).

Regardless of its being a pressure cooker, the pot itself is high quality;2. It is easy to clean;3. It is easy to use;4. It can make cooking go faster; and5. It forces flavor into meats and beans better.1. I was surprised by the quality of the actual pot itself.  I cook real food almost every day and have a nice pot set.  The aluminum sandwich bottom for this pot is better than any I've tried before.  When you're browning meats to enhance flavor and taking them off to brown onions and garlic, it is not uncommon to have scorched spots in the bottom of your pan because of where the flame hits it.  The heating on this pan is so even, that the browning effect (where so much flavor is!) is even as well.2. Because the browning is even, it's easier to clean, plus there are not too many parts to remove and clean.3. Although it works a little differently than some pressure cookers, bringing items up to temperature first and then putting the lid on is easy.  Wait for the first or second red line to appear (as directed in the accompanying cook book), and turn down the flame to very low.  You'll get the hang of it quickly.4. Cooking real food takes time.  Chopping onions, vegetables, meat, etc. is a chore and there's way around this fact.  Browning in the pan adds flavor, but also prep. time.  Where a good pressure cooker can help you is to reduce the time needed to simmer and enhance flavors.  Because so little steam escapes from this unit, all the flavors are forced together and intensified.  Example:  I have a bean recipe I got from a friend I've made regularly since 1998.  It's simple, flavorful, has few ingredients, and everyone loves it.  I make extra so that I can render the fat out of chorizo to make refried beans, which my kids love even more.  If you did not soak the beans the night before, you have to boil them hard for 1 hour, pour the water out, rinse the beans, put them back in, add the other ingredients, and wait 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  If you want beans tonight, you need to know in advance and start early.  BUT, with this pan you can \"pre-soak\" in 10 minutes time and have the beans ready, from start to finish, in under 1/2 an hour.  Stews, soups, broths all go ridiculously quickly and easily.  Even when preparing ingredients to add to a casserole, using this pot makes the entire process shorter.5.  I'll admit, I really don't understand why, but somehow using this pot intensifies flavors.  The first time I made the bean recipe I referenced above, both of my kids (14 & 16) like them better--and so did I.  Same ingredients, same amount of water (I could have used a lot less), better result.  That's been the case for just about every trusted recipe I've cooked in this thing.  But in less time.Yep.  This item's a little spendy.  It's worth it.\n","id":"88767692-7f20-4722-b686-0047aa009ee0"},{"text":"\n  A food goon friend of mine sold me on buying this \"overpriced\" pressure cooker by pointing out that it can be used as an autoclave.I have yet to autoclave anything in it, but it's still working excellently for food.The curry beans that I cooked last night went swimmingly -- twenty minutes at full temp, and then left to cool down normally.The cooker feels nice to use, and it looks elegant on the stovetop.

We've made vegetarian chili (using TVP instead of meat), Pan-in-pot method brown rice, pulled pork (from an 8+ pound shoulder roast) all with great success.  The puled pork was extremely tender and surprisingly delicious.  We also made one of the recipes from the included cookbook (Italian Chicken) and were delighted with the results.Most impressive is how quickly this cooker comes up to pressure and how quickly pressure releases using the natural release method.  One thing we needed to re-learn:  determining when to turn the heat down as the cooker gets to cooking pressure.  The older cooker makes a racket with the jiggler rocking and steam hissing. This one is very quiet and needs to be watched as it comes up to pressure so that it doesn't go beyond its proper cooking pressure.  We really appreciate how quickly this cooker responds to the flame adjustments on the stove.  Overall, we are impressed and sorry we waited so long to make this investment.  Like most good things in life, you get what you pay for...this is expensive and worth it!\n","id":"bd222042-2790-47cc-af0b-219a61b5fc3b"},{"text":"\n  Works get- when the housing unit is. It broken!

One to bring to work to hold the bottles as a pump, which I wish that the ice pack worked better because I do not have easy access to a fridge.

There are fantastic colorful photos throughout of not only the finished product, but tons of process photos. His instructions are crystal clear. The recipes are easy. Many require you to make your own stock, but it‚Äôs Dashi, and that only adds about 15 minutes to a recipe. There are little blurb boxes peppered throughout, called Japanese Grandmother Wisdom that are informative and charming.He has an ingredient glossary at the back, but no photos of ingredients. That‚Äôs the only bummer. If there are ingredients in a recipe that you‚Äôre unfamiliar with, it might be helpful to Google it before running to the store so that you know what you‚Äôre looking for.Pictured below:1) Ingredients for California Temaki2) California Temaki. It‚Äôs hand rolled sushi. I‚Äôve made sushi before, but not Temaki, its much easier, casual, rustic cousin. Delicious and so visually interesting and beautiful. Easy peasy. He mentions that you could put out the ingredients and let people pull together their own Temaki at a party. I could see that.3) Gyoza (Pork and Cabbage Dumplings ‚Äì Potstickers!!!) and Yasai Itame (Stir-Fried Vegetables). Amazing! These were the best potstickers we'd ever had!4) Yasai Tempura (Vegetable Tempura), and Shrimp Tempura. Wonderful! Mess warning! ;)5) Supagetti No Teriyaki (Chicken Teriyaki Spaghetti). Fantastic! You'll never buy teriyaki sauce again! If you put the water on to boil for the pasta, then get the chicken going, then get the teriyaki going, you'll be eating in 30 minutes. Great for a schedule pressed night.Some other things I have flagged to try are Spicy Tuna Temaki, Suteki Don (Steak Rice Bowls with Spicy Teriyaki Sauce), Tamago Supu (Japanese Egg Drop Soup), Dango Jiru (Japanese-Style Chicken and Dumpling Soup), Tsukune No Teriyaki (Chicken Meatballs with Teriyaki Sauce), Nasu No Misoyaki (Eggplant with Chicken and Miso Sauce), Tori No Teriyaki (Chicken Teriyaki), and Shumai (Japanese-Style Shrimp Dumplings).\n","id":"069d20fc-8617-4819-961d-5d07f75347bf"},{"text":"\n  The recipes are ok, nothing too special, as the title suggests they should be. But about 25% of the book constantly belittles western food and how Japanese versions are superior or Japanese people have been doing certain things better than the rest of the world for hundreds of years, etc. It really makes the book a nuisance. At one point for example, the Japanese author talks about how he has tasted enough fried chicken to know that Japanese know how to make the best fried chicken in the world. Or how Japanese  have known for years how to make soup base superior to French soup base for a fraction of the time. Ok really? It‚Äôs fine to have pride in one‚Äôs heritage but this author keeps getting on my nerves by constantly belittling other cuisines\n","id":"6c3f9ca6-64bc-44fa-8ee8-8647b2e94c10"},{"text":"\n  This is a decent, but not amazing Japanese cookbook. As an avid fan of Japanese cooking, I own 10+ cookbooks and being a fan of Morimoto, this one was a little disappointing. While the recipes are OK, they tend towards the Americanized versions of the dishes with a flavor balance towards the very salty and very sweet flavors - consider reducing sugar and soy from written recipes and add more later if needed. Too many Japanese cookbooks teach Teriyaki sauce and Miso Soup, and I was hoping for Morimoto's to teach more more modern home dishes such as Yakiniku and Shabu Shabu sauces. Additionally, even though the recipes are geared towards home cooks, they still on average tend to require at least 5-10 ingredients and 1 hour or more. If you're looking for simple yet very delicious Japanese home cooking, I recommend starting with Japanese Home Cooking by Yoshihiro Murata, also found on Amazon. The recipes look deceptively simple but they are the best versions around! The reason I still give this cookbook 4 stars is that I've learned a few good tips and tricks from the book and there are some advanced recipes which I will try soon and update the review.

I think it is better to alternate among different types of cookware instead of cooking each meal in Vinod 2L Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker; however, I eventually decided to return this pressure cooker to amazon.com - with the reason for return \"No Longer Needed\" and with the explanation \"I used it several times for cooking food; its stainless-steel is definitely superior to that of Hawkins pressure cooker; however, it leaches metals into food to a small extent which build-up in body\" - and I paid $9.75 to amazon.com for its return shipping. This return was very difficult for me to submit and I am not changing the rating of this pressure cooker from my earlier rating of 4 stars; however, I am returning this pressure cooker with love and with the hope that the cookware companies may do more research and develop cookware such that if at all the cookware leaches anything into the food, it only supplements the food cooked in it and makes the food more nutritious. Food that nourishes the body and does not overload the body with heavy metals or toxins, is more important than how fast the cookware heats and whether it takes 20 minutes to cook food or 1 hour to cook food. Cookware that may take longer to prepare food but does not leach heavy metals or toxins into the food, may in fact promote heath and prolong the lifespans of the people and thereby compensate for the extra time spent on preparing food.Blessings to all.Bye.--------------------Based upon the taste of the food cooked in Vinod V-2L Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, I think that the quality of stainless steel (Salem Steel) used to make this pressure cooker is SUPERIOR than the quality of stainless steel used to make two other pressure cookers (Hawkins and Prestige) that I purchased last month before I purchased this Vinod V-2L Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. The food cooked in Hawkins and Prestige pressure cookers had stronger metallic \"aftertaste\" than the food cooked in Vinod V-2L Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. Of the three pressure cookers I purchased (Hawkins, Prestige, Vinod) over the duration of about a month, the food cooked in Hawkins 3L Induction Compatible 18/8 Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker had the \"strongest\" metallic \"aftertaste\" and its harsh effect on the body was cumulative because after eating food cooked in that pressure cooker for about 3-4 days I had got blisters in the mouth and inflammation in the throat - the symptoms resolved on their own when I stopped eating food cooked in that pressure cooker; I returned that Hawkins pressure cooker back to Hawkins Cookers Ltd. so that they can test its composition and then correct their manufacturing process and improve the quality of their product; however, based on my experience, I can say that its 18/8 stainless steel was not of food grade quality. I must also mention that I had used the Hawkins Pressure Cooker to cook food on an electric hot plate stove and not on an induction stove.I like the finish on the inside surface of the Vinod V-2L Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker because the food does not easily stick to it while cooking food; and, if some food does get stuck on the cooker, it washes off easily. I have given it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because I think that the quality of the workmanship of this pressure cooker needs to be improved or the thickness of its stainless steel needs to be increased - because some of the rivets on each of its two handles can be seen and felt on the inside surface of the cooker and they get stained while cooking food (see attached photo).BASED ON MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH PREPARING FOOD IN DIFFERENT STAINLESS-STEEL COOKWARE (VINOD, PRESTIGE, HAWKINS, LENOX, CUISINART, BARAZZONI, ROSLE), I THINK THAT THE OVERALL FOOD GRADE QUALITY OF STAINLESS-STEEL COOKWARE HAS DETERIORATED DUE TO MAKING THEM INDUCTION COMPATIBLE; BECAUSE, EITHER THE FOOD COOKED IN THESE INDUCTION COMPATIBLE STAINLESS-STEEL COOKWARE HAS METALLIC AFTERTASTE, OR THE FOOD COOKED IN THESE NEW 18/8 STAINLESS STEEL PRESSURE COOKERS FEELS HARSH (TO A VARYING DEGREE) TO THE SOFT TISSUE IN THE MOUTH; I THINK THAT THE COOKWARE COMPANIES MAY HAVE CHANGED THE PROPORTION OF IRON AND CARBON IN THE STAINLESS STEEL TO MAKE THEIR COOKWARE INDUCTION COMPATIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE REDUCED THE FOOD-GRADE QUALITY OF THEIR COOKWARE. ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT COOKED FOOD ON AN INDUCTION STOVE TOP, HOWEVER, BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING, IT IS MY OWN THINKING THAT THE OVERALL HEALTH-GIVING QUALITY OF THE FOOD COOKED ON AN INDUCTION STOVE IS LESS THAN THAT OF THE FOOD COOKED ON HEAT-BASED COOKTOP. IT IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT WHAT FOOD PEOPLE EAT, BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT HOW THE FOOD IS PREPARED. SHOULD THE FOOD BE COOKED GENTLY OR BY AGITATION? IF FERRITIC STAINLESS-STEEL COOKWARE CAN GET AGITATED BY AN INDUCTION STOVE, CAN THE BEANS, GRAINS AND VEGETABLES THAT CONTAIN IRON NOT GET AGITATED BY AN INDUCTION STOVE?

I have a 7 liter that I bought in a store in my country and use once per week for the past 20 years to do red beans and chick peas.  I have bought 2 other pressure pots because I prepare meals in large quantities thrice per year during Ramadan (Muslim fasting period )and needed to use 2 pots simultaneously to expedite the cooking. The other brands were ruined because of plastic and complex locking system although they were stainless steel pots.  I checked the internet for Vinod and tried to buy a pot directly but the transaction was not going through.  I just thought I‚Äôd check amazon to see if they carry Vinod and was very happy and immediately ordered one.  I have left my country to study in Egypt and needed to bring a small pressure pot for a single person.  This is perfect for my situation and works great doing my unsoaked beans in 20 minutes.  The issue of the emission of steam when the pressuring begins once per minute or so is an advantage for me as if I‚Äôm not in proximity of my clock especially in my flower garden watering my plants I can easily count 20 of those emissions and then tend to switching off the cooker.\n","id":"a06316a7-d43c-4614-a5db-0eb179ba79df"},{"text":"\n  I have prestige and hockins pressure cookers. My first time with using Vinod pressure cooker. I thought of giving this brand a chance comparing the prices. Not worth even this lower price. I made dal khichadi which had ample amount of water.

After opening I saw there was water on the top of the khichadi but it was burnt all over the bottom. I am cooking khichadi since last 30 years and used pressure cookers all the time and this is the first time in my life it burnt.Not worth it...

I'm OK with leftovers, and remember you can't fill it all the way up.My one complaint is, if you don't twist it closed properly, it works, but it becomes really difficult to twist it open.

Seal and cook on the \"stew\" function for 35 minutes in my Instant Pot and what comes out is extremely tender, flavorful and juicy. I usually scoop out the carnitas (I've made with both pork butt and tenderloin and both come out fabulous) and place them under the broiler in a cast iron pan until the tops get a nice char to finish them off.  They're great over rice and as a sandwich. But of course, nothing beats tortillas. This is a great spice mix.
