[{"text":"\n  Very nice colour\n","id":"c0d1b8e0-d201-498d-95c8-6757bd19bb58"},{"text":"\n  This is my new favorite lip color, for the simple fact that the pigmentation and formula is amazing. I truly struggle to find the perfect shade because ofMy skin color, if it’s too red it smudges around my lips and I look crazy I also feel like it makes my teeth look yellow when they are so not, but this color has a dark shade to it and I actually makes my teeth look white because of how shaded it is, plus there is sooo much product I would definitely pay over 20$ for this project but it’s for under 4$ even better!! I have a subscription monthly so I can’t wait to try more colors! By the way these photos are my lips after 10 hrs of work plus eating a burrito and drinking my coffee for breakfast and eating a chicken chalupa with a can coke for lunch plus some cookies and more coffee (no straws) and having a big lasagna dinner! Yes I love to eat but I also love to look this good while eating ;) thank you sooo much!\n","id":"5a9cf13e-f6aa-4ba4-9005-e7956667256c"},{"text":"\n  i just got it and try it on.for now it feels really good and easy to apply. best lipstick i have\n","id":"d8acf436-e721-4f75-b21f-6af97b51ab5d"},{"text":"\n  LOVE this lipstick. I got the color Sub-Saharan. It’s a deep burnt orange matte lip color. Love the applicator, and the smoothness of going in. It’s lasted me just about 10 hours. One of my favorite colors!\n","id":"1b2a95b9-327b-4ad7-b9fd-90e673a85eb6"},{"text":"\n  My absolute favorite Liquid Lipstick! The Mousse version is amazing. Stays on well, drys quickly during the application. Does not flake throughout the day.You will need to re apply after eating but overall it holds up well.And it feels super light weight.\n","id":"8b89d325-3c25-4618-8e75-6b3b017790c5"},{"text":"\n  I have dozens of red lipsticks.  Why you ask?  Because not all red lipsticks are equal.  Some make your teeth look yellow like a toxic substance, others are unflattering to your skin tone and then a lot of them are drying or bleed or smear all over your face.  I know I can put this lipstick on in the morning (even though I'm not going anywhere I still wear it - strictly for me) and it will still look good before I take it off at night.  So it lasts through lunch, dinner, a snack or 2 and several coffees, pops, waters and tea.  If I eat something that has some oil in it the inner part of my lips might need a touch up but normally I don't touch it all day.  It makes me look better with it than I look without it.  Even my adult son who mostly hates the look of lipsticks on anyone has complimented me on this lipstick.  I think his exact words were - 'nice lipstick'!  That's as good a compliment as I've ever gotten.  I will keep this one in stock.\n","id":"f719baa0-80a8-43d7-aa6f-f3c02e5b349e"},{"text":"\n  The item seems sturdy. You can definitely get some miles out of it. Flexible enough to get it inside the mask. Not sure if it can withstand a dryer, so make sure to take it out to be on the safe side. Can easily be hand washed.One and only complaint: It is a smaller than I expected. It sits on the nose well, but lands just under the bottom lip, I expected it to sit on the chin. As long as you don't talk a mile a minute with your mouth wide open then it will work.\n","id":"d5985385-92e6-4240-a0b2-95fde221835a"},{"text":"\n  Really great! Love the colors and the keys. It does make a bit of noise unlike my other mechanical keyboard but this one is really great for the price. I do however wish there was a USB port on the keyboard as well as the backlight keyboard. My one issue is that when the computer goes to sleep the lights still stay on so you have to constantly push the on off switch. Which means every time you turn off the back light whatever setting you have your backlight set to will auto rest to the original. So that’s my one complaint. Other than that great product!\n","id":"c3ff601f-f271-406f-afe0-abbd46b4e164"},{"text":"\n  Are you serious? This keyboard is amazing! I love it so much. I actually look forward to work so that I can use it. It so sturdy but its dainty at the same time. The key placement is perfect. I'm loving the way it feels when I type and it's actually quieter than my old membrane keyboard. I cannot say enough good things about it. Very chic and stylish. I'm over the moon with the chrome detailing. There was a tiny chip in the shift key on the left but I plan to get in contact with them to request a replacement.\n","id":"f30d4d0c-c52f-4c36-9cd3-ba63b19d7257"},{"text":"\n  I bought this as an extra keyboard so I’d only need to move my laptop and not my whole set up when working in the living room away from my desk.  The colors bring a smile to my face, I adore the typewriter clicking sound, and the lights work perfectly.  The only problem is that my daughter keeps trying to steal it from me.  She’s nineteen and knows better.It’s fun, cute and works great; I love it!\n","id":"2f9f04af-9ec8-4eda-9733-2467a6062855"},{"text":"\n  I have been using this keyboard for 8-9 hours a day for the last 3 weeks while working from home..... and I LOVE IT!!! It types so effortlessly, and the lighting is to die for!! It has the clicky sound you would expect from a mechanical keyboard, but it’s not painfully loud. It literally is a joy using this keyboard everyday! Not to mention the color of the keys make me happy!\n","id":"0a540d87-bd30-44a1-b96f-480ee524f6b4"},{"text":"\n  Amazing.  I use it at work and all of my co-workers want one. The sound of it is nice  its not loud like the old school typewriter, its a bit louder than a normal keyboard..Its very pleasant. If your thinking about purchasing it, think no further..it's worth every penny!\n","id":"8b609913-a14a-4219-bd01-e1bab1100c53"},{"text":"\n  I bought it to try since it was so cheap then, but its pink for my lips. Also there wasn't any seal, so that wasn't nice.\n","id":"afe30c61-780e-4760-bbac-147b679910ea"},{"text":"\n  I absolutely love this Burt's Bee's line--but do not buy them off of Amazon!! I've bought several on Amazon as well as in store, and the ones in store have kept just fine, while the ones (even in different colors) that I bought off Amazon get bumpy and weird! Yuck! Buy these lipsticks (they're GREAT)--just NOT on Amazon!!\n","id":"c173fcd2-bfe7-4b89-a8d9-2d8a08da8d2d"},{"text":"\n  I got the color in BLUSH BASIN.  In person the shade is more \"pinky\" than it appeared to be on the photos.  I have a medium brown skin tone so that may be why.  I took photos while wearing it with the flash and without. over all it's okay, it is hydrating at first and then it does get a little crusty looking after a few hours and it will bleed out and move around your lips a lot.  I wish i had gotten a darker shade for my skin tone, maybe i would have better results if it matched my lips more.  Also i noticed after applying the lipstick with CLEAN lips, the lipstick had lumps and bumps after applying. Weird!  I don't know if i got a bad one or it's really old, but i only used it once and it got bumpy. What gives? Oh well. Glad i was able to get my refund for this fail.\n","id":"bab6b1ee-4c8b-43ef-b8df-1e6386b56fba"},{"text":"\n  blush basin,I love this color.\n","id":"253d5bbc-f0ee-4841-8343-60d7d3c351ea"},{"text":"\n  I have every other Burts Bees lip product so I thought I would try the new lipstick.  I have fair skin so thought Blush Basin might work for me.  It does!  It's a very soft dusty pink, not too matte and not greasy looking either.  It's a bit deeper than my natural lip color which I like.  So far it's lasted a few hours and looks great!  Worth the money and I will buy again!  Another Winner from Burts Bees!\n","id":"b2309601-ddbe-43af-bdd8-c5f7e1be99ab"},{"text":"\n  Best lipstick I've tried in ages.  The color is as I expected (and exactly what I wanted) and it goes on nicely, smooth and even with good (though not heavy) coloring.  I do have to reapply often, and it does come off a bit on glasses when fresh - but I don't feel that plasticy grease most lipsticks leave behind nor have any strange taste.  I hope this colorway is a permanent line as I finally have a lipstick I use.\n","id":"a1fc07d9-1701-47b3-9ed8-602cff66f960"},{"text":"\n  I always stuck with a specific lip gloss, but wanted to branch out to discover what other brands were out there and what worked well for my skin tone. I really love this lipstick as the shade compliments my skin tone fairly well. It gives off that sweet girl look and I now wear it to casual events or parties!\n","id":"ece49737-cb65-4f08-a9f3-1139f9fa0bff"},{"text":"\n  I like the color suite my tan skin .

Very nice colour!\n","id":"db31dd30-c4ce-494d-89fb-e4a481d79a90"},{"text":"\n  I have been wearing Lip Finity for years now, my absolute fave color was 050 (mauve) but it has been discontinued, alas. I tried my luck with this shade, Essential Pink, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a change from the rather darkish, sort of brownish pink that I was using, this is a very soft frosted pink, almost nude, and it softens the features. Not that it gets much seen, haha, what with the masks and all that one is required to wear in public, but I don't wear a mask while jogging outdoors and wear it then. The main feature is that I apply it in the morning and it stays put the whole day through. I wear it with a darker lip liner which sets it off by contrast. And it stays even after eating. If you want to refresh it you just apply the balm of step 2, no need to reapply the color. I only gave it a 4-star rating in value for price because I find it a bit pricey compared with the last ones, but it has been a while since my last purchase so it figures that it would be priced higher, plus it's no longer produced in the US, so you have to take that into account to.\n","id":"9bb64427-289f-4a6c-9868-5d4ea49b4729"},{"text":"\n  I use the colors \"Blush\" and \"Artesian Pink\". Together they make a perfect color for me every day. I have very pale white skin so colors are best sort of muted and natural. The blush is darker, the artesian pink a light sweet pink. They last a lot longer than anything else (think dinner party, wiping mouth with napkin, sipping something, licking lips, etc and going to the restroom to find that you STILL have lipstick there!) . When I'm outside in day & really casual I wear only Artesean Pink. When going out I wear Blush on my upper lip & outline my bottom with it to form a better lip line. Fill in & go over wth Artesian Pink in middle of lips. Blush also worn alone gives me a more polished formal look. I wear LipInk's Shine in the middle of my lips after everything's dried - but don't find myself bothering with it as much. I'm not that into checking myself so often. Hence, my attraction to LipInk in the first place. In front of the public it's something I've found indispensable . Also easier to tuck into a pocket or purse than a big tube of lipstick (for me)\n","id":"ddebe686-cc16-419d-b1f5-6ebcbb84db92"},{"text":"\n  I have used this brand of lipstick for years and years.  For staying on the lips, non smudges, and no bleeding, this is HANDS DOWN THE BEST STAY ON LIPSTICK ON THE MARKET.  I only wish my color was more accessible.  185 sultry.  Anyone have that color?\n","id":"fa52752b-6bfc-4296-aef7-2e1c786e45d4"},{"text":"\n  I love this product. I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day and into the evening.

It’s a little sticky when you first apply it, but I put a light layer Chapstick over it to give it a smooth feel my lips.  I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on the colors, my sister even tried to “borrow” it.. y’all know how that goes.\n","id":"7fd33f3c-f27f-4b77-ab0d-05e2ab7450b2"},{"text":"\n  I absolutely love this.

You slide them on and they instantly look a bit darker, fine, but then they get darker and darker as they dry. To the point where every stain in the box is actually a super deep color.\n","id":"2deda5ee-3a1b-41eb-a92c-32dca24f02fb"},{"text":"\n  Gotta love MAC\n","id":"81842068-0070-4ee1-a864-4af7712f8c16"},{"text":"\n  Prompt delivery, high quality product!\n","id":"4c19d28b-c81b-43f2-94eb-3dc1217fd15f"},{"text":"\n  I used these to give as gifts with my homemade peppermint lip balm and everyone loved them!

Thanks to all this mask wearing I have been reaching for my chapstick way more often.  I am sure if breathing in the mask is doing it, because I would think that would make them more humid.  Or if after I take the mask off the lack of humidity is now causing them to feel dry.  Either way I am using my chapstick way more frequently.  For this reason I was trying to find a way to keep my chapstick handy.  Nothing is worse than digging around in your bag because you cant find it when you need it.  Even worse is setting it down somewhere in the house and not remembering where that somewhere is.I also love that they come with matching wristlets to keep your keys on.  I love matching sets in general but I do love wristlets for keys.  Not only because I think they are convenient for carrying them when you are out without a purse but because they don’t really add any weight to your keys which is always nice when you have a lot of keys.  The patterns on the sets are just as vibrant in person as they are in the pictures.  They are also very soft against your wrist when you are wearing them.  I put standard round tubes of chapstick in them to test and they all fit just fine.These are super cute and ready to be gifted.  I think I am going to put a set in my daughter, mother-in-law and sisters stockings.

So having my keys on something similar is very convenient.  I shared these with my co-workers and they were all thrilled with them.  And enough patterns to find one that everyone loved.  Most of them liked the lipstick/balm holder because they said they were always loosing their lip balms and this was perfect to make sure it was always where they needed it.

The booklet provides a nice historical background of the New York Dolls. But of course it's not the Dolls one listens to with this disc. It's their influences.What makes this a great collection are the songs that appear here which are not the customary ones. For example there is the somewhat obligatory inclusion of Eddie Cochran but it's not Summertime Blues or 20 Flight Rock; it's Somethin' Else (ironic isn't it?). Many more where the names are the same but the songs are more obscure entries: Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Elvis, the Coasters, the Chambers Brothers, etc. Sure the artists that influenced them are repeats of other mostly English bands that have come out, frequently on Mojo's in house label. But if these are truly the songs of influence this is a cool revelation.Still, The Jayhawks and not the Cadets. That's a choice of version made by very few.

First, they make it much easier to breathe.  I used to take my mask off as soon as I got home--it felt hot and made it a bit more difficult to breathe.  Now I find that I almost forget to take my mask off when I get home because it's so easy to breathe with it on.  I'm using the same masks so it is definitely the bracket that's making the difference.Second, the bracket keeps the mask off your face--so no mask rash.  I was getting a red spot on my face from wearing the masks, and these solved that problem.Third, these brackets help you breathe more through the mask.  In other works, you are actually using the mask more as a filter when you have the bracket in.  Without the bracket, I feel like I'm mostly breathing in air from the gaps around the mask.  But with the bracket I'm breathing in air from the front of the mask.  That's pretty worthwhile, when you think about it.I have not been able to see the different bracket colors through the mask--so you should be able to use any color with the standard blue/green medical masks.Highly Recommended!!!\n","id":"3963ef60-6a2c-4212-9703-9505e0734416"},{"text":"\n  These are great for my fabric masks.

Just the added space between my mouth and the mask is really nice.

I'm normally not the \"write a review type\" but I am so in love with the colors and the creamy consistency of these lipsticks that I had to share because it was the previous reviews that influenced me to buy this. The lipsticks feel very moisturizing on my lips and the color is buildable (can layer to add more definition) and you only need a little bit as I scooped out just a dab to sample with my makeup/mixing spatula & coverage was ample. The colors can definitely be mixed to make other colors or even an hombre effect. I'm very happy with this purchase and relieved that my judgement, based upon the reviews, was good! I have always been a fan mostly of MAC products but this is a lot of bang for your buck! The case is cute and trendy too. I was very excited to try these on my clients and very pleased with the outcome. Also ordered Italia Deluxe liners and love those as well. Very pigmented and pairs well with these colors. There is also a generous amount of lipstick in each container. Karity eye shadows are good too and very pigmented!\n","id":"127cf6e0-8ac9-4b41-bb30-33c925ddd8cb"},{"text":"\n  A beautiful palette of lipcolors with nice pigmentation. They're creamy, blendable, and easy to apply with a brush or with your finger. The color lasted a few hours on my lips. I reapplied after eating and drinking. The lipcolors have no scent to them that I can detect, which is nice. The packaging is pretty, and the palette itself is nice and sturdy. I can't tell if it's paperboard covered plastic, or if it's just a strong paperboard, but I like the feel of it. The size fits just right in the hand, and there is plenty of product in the individual pans to get a lot of use out of it. The magnetic closure works very well, so I don't have to worry about it falling open in my bag. Overall, a very nice product. I wouldn't hesitate to give this palette as a gift, or keep in a makeup kit to take to events.\n","id":"f2af68cc-0e2e-469e-9778-9c981c3b3074"},{"text":"\n  I was excited for these to arrive, though I hoped I'd like the colors better in person than they looked on my computer.I can't wear any of the colors without feeling like my piano teacher back in the 80s, an elderly lady with crazy hot pink lipstick who smelled weird. Of course, that's just my personal thing and I always feel self conscious in bright lipsticks. My lower rating is because I also didn't care for how they wear and how quickly they wore off.

The quality is good. With lipstick what you see is what you get. The pallette is great for creating ombre lips if that is your thing. The longevity is... Hit and miss depending on how much you use your mouth. I bought it because I'm a carmex lip person. And I don't use alot of color. But this pallette has a little bit of everything. And a perfect addition to my very small lip color collection. I would suggest it for some pretty awesome lip looks.

This is a great buy for the price, and as someone who doesn't wear lipstick a lot, I know this will last a while. I also like the quality of the case.

It's not the most affordable, but is certainly quality. My lips are always soft. The gloss itself is all natural and smooth, of course, and the colors are all amazing. I love the Hibiscus and Red Dahlia, but I've also tried the Rose and Caramel. I'm including a photo so you can see the color. On my hand I've got, from wrist to knuckles, the Red Dahlia, Hibiscus, then the Burt's Bees Scarlet Soaked Lipstick. This is so you can see the difference between the gloss and the lipstick product. I'm fair-skinned and haven't found that any of the colors look poorly on me yet. If you apply it a bit thicker the color is darker, so keep that in mind. A light application goes a long way for smoothness and gives you a more natural color. You will leave a slight lip print on any drinkware, so be careful. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because often near the end of the tube these pop out and you can't get them to stay in the tube. Thus, you have to open it carefully or transfer it to another container.\n","id":"5c6757d7-1490-4b02-bf8b-85873811c99a"},{"text":"\n  This product was supposed to come with TWO lip balms for the price of $9.84.

In truth I'm slightly disappointed because I picked the darker Red Dahlia color hoping it would be more pigmented than the pink colors.

However I do enjoy the product as it is very moisturizing, smells nice and has nice packaging. I think this would be most suitable for places where you don't want to look like you are wearing makeup like the gym or beach. The product does make me look a little healthier and less pale. It's sort of a natural flush.

It's by the creator of 'Sex and the City' so you know everyone is going to look good in clothes, see plenty of action without clothes, and either eat in restaurants or order take-out. In a stunning innovative feature of this series, one character is shown to know how to cook.The three women whose lives are the center of the story are believable in their roles, even if the New York City life they lead pushes the limits of credibility at times. They are gorgeous but have a little more depth than Samantha, Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda. The men they bed and wed (or not) also have more depth than the boys and men of SATC.Although the series ended too soon, i felt like the relationships would continue. No fatal flaws in the men in the lives of these women - they may be immature (but would  grow up fast), mistrustful (but would dare to trust), or insecure about financial success (but would go on to succeed); there was no Mr. Big in this series with several marriages behind him and a tendency to cheat.I'm glad I watched the entire series because I have a new respect for Brooke Shields. She juggled the most balls of these multi-tasking women and she dropped a few. Her portrayal of a frustrated stay at home mom was not strident and it showed how one woman could approach the situation creatively.\n","id":"0c2dd0d2-2204-4bc5-9a87-03e1f7e9d091"},{"text":"\n  Great work!

They last all day for me, even after eating and drinking.Some things you need to know:1. The colors continue to get darker as they dry. (Compare product photo of wet lipstick to applied photo with dry lips)2. Extremely matte. The agent added for this effect is very drying, so be sure to exfoliate and moisturize before you apply, or you will see imperfections you didn't know existed on your lips.3. Applicator makes it difficult to create a straight edge (see photo, applied with provided applicator). You should use a liner (does not come with this set) and probably your own lipstick applicator brush to be more precise.When I purchased, the colors were Dazed, Bittersweet and Hudson. I love these colors for special occasions, but think they're too dark for everyday use. You can layer a brighter color on top and use every day, if you wish.

I bought mine 3 months ago, and the one time I wore one- I chose spice, I needed to reapply literally between leaving my house and getting to work.

Super dry.-it doesn't even smell good? I expected this stuff to smell amazing but it was super subtle from the start and not that great, and what's more: after having it for a little over a month, it smells terrible as I assume the oil went rancid. Oil does not go rancid in a month so I assume this was a pretty old batch!-the salt is painful, whether it be the coarseness of the salt or the burning.-it does not leave me feeling moisturized, just a tad greasy and mostly just irritated.NOT good for sensitive skin at all.I definitely won't be buying this again.\n","id":"d89380a7-6fe7-4cd4-a7a6-2ff65c67fb87"},{"text":"\n  So dissapointing especially since the product has good reviews.

Most lipsticks turn into a color that's nothing remotely close to the one you thought you purchased, or they dry out your lips, or they just don't look nice. But, eureka -- I found two colors here that work for me perfectly. Both the black and pink honey are honestly shades that I can wear. I hate the matte look, mainly because I'm older and need the moisture for my lips. The honey lipstick is almost like a lip balm with color, but color you can layer, and color that looks great no matter how many layers you put on. You get that soft, moist, subtle semi-sheer look. Both colors are keepers and I will definitely be ordering these again.\n","id":"ccecfb20-4666-4325-bc3b-546333d87841"},{"text":"\n  Gave my elderly sister, (88 years young!) set of 2 flattering Clinique lipsticks for a Christmas gift.

Tested today at work with a fabric mask and it did make a difference.  I am on my feet running around a store and our AC doesn't work very well and we're under a heat advisory. I have a fabric mask. The little clips don't work currently because of how the mask faces (my fault). I do have some fogging of my glasses, but if you have the metal nose clip (I use pipe cleaners stapled in, I'm lazy 😁) that takes care of that issue. It does get a little sticky against the skin, but not overly bothersome. All in all I like it. It keeps the fabric from sucking against your mouth and nose. It's more comfortable than I was expecting. I give it 3.5 stars, but only because I still need the metal nose clip.*Editing to add: I had a single use mask and tried the bracket with that while grocery shopping. Now that was a marked difference! I highly recommend with those masks for sure.

Or if you have a loved one that’s an alcoholic.  I grew up with an alcoholic and it took me a long time to understand that once it reached a certain point, my Mom no longer had control. But it didn’t mean she didn’t love me; it meant she desperately needed help.  Thankfully she got it and has been sober 21 years! Addicts need help to achieve sobriety. They need intervention and major consequences. Absolutely hold them accountable but if you want to hate something, hate the gene that causes a person to be prone to abusing alcohol, hate their actions, don’t hate the person because they hate themselves enough for everyone.A lot of the poor reviews only serve to prove precisely what the documentary statistics state: The judgment and stigma associated with addiction (in this case, alcohol) and women.  People don’t think as poorly about a drunk man as they do when they see a drunk female.  I’ve witnessed this on countless occasions in my profession.  The rate of addiction in the USA is astronomical and it’s not even remotely only limited to chemicals.  Unfortunately people don’t judge themselves (they’re too busy judging others) or they justify their addictions by saying things like, “Well I’m not some junkie/drunk. I just like to gamble/ smoke/ have sex/ exercise/ eat good food/ I NEED the prescribed pills to help with sleep/pain... etc, etc, etc.”  Anyone who works to get sober from a chemical dependency should feel incredibly proud and not worry one bit about what others say or think.  It’s not their life and for a “Christian Nation” this country is packed full of UN-CHRISTIAN behavior, incessant and cruel judgement and outright abuse and bullying from the ‘holier than thou’ crowd (which is really just a reflection of how they feel about themselves and their upbringing).This film gives a first hand look at women alcoholics through personal interviews, family accounts and experiences, the tragedies and triumphs, and it provides valuable statistics on alcoholism.If you’re a person without sin, who has the authority to cast judgement, I’d advise you not to watch this.  “Finding Nemo” might be more up your alley!\n","id":"6769c2e9-9801-4a2b-8fe5-0b791a2a22c2"},{"text":"\n  After reading the reviews, I had to post a positive review just to raise the reviews.

Try a little kindness instead of harsh criticism that it did not have you on the edge of your seat.  One (probably more) of your close friends is struggling RIGHT NOW with addiction.  I hope that you can be there for her (or him!) and be more kind than you were to the women who shared their stories in this film.

This is a problem that crosses social-economic lines, races, religions, ages, etc. I would have liked for some women from different backgrounds speak about their experiences -- what kind of treatment is available for women without health insurance? How does someone with limited finances or a lack of formal education cope? What about women whose culture/religion frowns upon treatment? Shut-ins, the elderly, the disabled?

This is big enough for Kat Von D lipsticks and even big enough for my STROBE GENIUS stick from NYX cosmetics, which is just a teeny bit bigger than the Kat Von D lipstick!!\n","id":"0bcd7d83-7d16-4aa9-a6a4-c63adeac491f"},{"text":"\n  These are such good quality. I thought for the price they would be a little chintzy, but nope! The silicone support piece are nice and thick, and help support thinner and taller lipsticks/glosses. You still cant put anything really tall and thin like the colourpop liquid lips without them kind of slanting to the side, but pretty much everything else stands in it great! there is a small edge around the outside of the entire container, so two don't sit flush against each other, but its a very small edge.\n","id":"03e12f33-748c-4487-8507-39357637e602"},{"text":"\n  I've been using these organizers to store 5-15ml bottles of essential oils and they work great.

I love having everything neatly laid out in front of me, I can compare lipstick colors, finishes, and labels all in one glance. Other organizers don’t fit in a drawer since they are made in tall steps (like high school bleachers.... and who wants that image in your head while choosing lipstick?!) These trays are beautifully made and heavy, clear plastic that I can’t imagine breaking. The spaces are large enough to fit different brands and sizes, with sturdy rubber overlays to accommodate thin lipstick cases, by holding them upright and neat. These rubber sections simply snap on and off if you would like to remove them. The cases fit perfectly in my Alex desks, and are one of the best buys I have made for organizing my substantial horde. They would also be great for pigments, glitter and other small cased cosmetics. Highly recommended!\n","id":"883c3ab7-9712-4efe-a668-f2a49484bc5b"},{"text":"\n  This is exactly what I was looking for! Fits all large based lipsticks such as Tom Ford, Kat Von D Studded Kiss, Marc Jacobs and any other brand that doesnt fit in standard lipstick organizers.

So easy to set a table for a dinner party at the last minute. Quality is good, size is good. Easily accomadates a charger, glassware, silver with room to spare. They wash well but do not put in dryer because they lose their shape. I usually toss after two uses. It seems wasteful, but if I wanted to wash and iron placemats and napkins, I would use sets that I already own.\n","id":"5e438094-6e99-4a7e-b43e-9238785dccd8"},{"text":"\n  I used these placemats at a baby shower for 30 people. I thought they were great because I needed a lot of placemats in grey which is a color I wouldn't normally use. They set a beautiful table and the color was perfect for the grey, yellow and turquoise theme of the party. I received many compliments on them. The reason I am rating 3 stars is that they did not wash up as nicely as other reviewers have stated. They cleaned up but they shrunk and are extremely wrinkled. Even after ironing them they still look wrinkled. I would not be able to use these with the remaining placemats on the roll. I doubt I would even use them as placemats after the first wash. But I think they can be used as tea towels to dry dishes. Or to use as towels to wipe up the counters. They will last longer than a paper towel. If I was doing another party and needed a lot of placemats in a color that I did not want to buy to own, I would purchase these again. I just would not expect to be able to wash and reuse them for the same purpose.\n","id":"53345139-4952-4aea-8891-9b30845d5e3d"},{"text":"\n  I like that it can be separated!!!\n","id":"9d44d66d-590f-48cc-8b2e-18d7965dcd76"},{"text":"\n  Es excelente la cartera, el color hermoso y la calidad.

That being said, I only give this 4/5 because the corner of the box was broken when it got here. It’s not very big so I will continue to use it, but it is still very noticeable and if so many of the boxes shipped out, weren’t defective, I think this product would be so much better. Also the lid feels like it could be easily broken so you have to be careful with that. And because of the shiny lid, a bunch of fingerprint easily show up on the lid and it has to be cleaned frequently bc of that.\n","id":"acdb7709-9b49-4004-a408-cf469ea822f8"},{"text":"\n  I have a bathroom vanity with no drawers so my cosmetics stay out on the counter - these organizers are not only attractive (I got the Rose Gold Lids) but very functional.

I'm obsessed.\n","id":"eeb498b0-59ad-4fd2-9474-6e5837b0d1aa"},{"text":"\n  All lipsticks arrived on time and in tact. Hopefully your will too!☆I ordered 3 shades:☆•Nude Nuance: pure nude that's more brown than pink. Perfect for darker complected girls that are worried about a nude lipstick washing them out. If you're a lighter skined person, this will look more like a rich almond.•Touch of Spice: Definitely my favorite from the entire line. If you don't know which one to get, buy this one! It's a universal shade that will match well with any outfit or occasion. Understated enough for work, but playful enough for a night out. It has an essence of greyish purple to it, which will suit any skin tone.•Burgundy Blush: if you're looking for a highly pigmented lipstick that's one shade darker than divine wine, then this one is just for you! It applies smoothly a consistently with just one swipe, and it stays on all day. Super creamy.\n","id":"bcb75abc-1df7-4de4-8997-6317696335ff"},{"text":"\n  This color is amazing , lasts for hours !Could never find it in stock at store though , so ordering was the only way to get ahold of this lipstick , shipping was super duper fast!

I compared multiple ones and decide to go with this product. They are super soft and with the perfect size and right number of pads.

The additional little flap that allows you to hold the pad  Can use for toners and mildly exfoliating my face, but...The Bad: It's still too rough, especially upon repeat washing, to use on my eye area.  I definitely can't use them for makeup removal, becasue if I try to use it, I have to be very very gentle, which usually leads to lots of leftover makeup.The Bottom Line: I would repurchase these, but only for my face for a very limited use.\n","id":"15c35a39-9877-45e3-9e2c-f9f1def3981b"},{"text":"\n  This is a great idea to save on disposable cotton pad usage.  I was getting concerned with my lifelong toner habit and the waste of cotton pads, so I looked up some reusable pads.  These are very nice with a little pocket to better grip, although this makes them a little slow to dry and I am not really sure that the pocket is really necessary.  They come with a little zippered pouch to throw in the wash, which is also nice.  They have held up well in several washes and are still soft and absorbent.  The only other negative is that when I purchased these a few months ago, it was an 18 pack with 6 of each of the three colors (beige, grey, black), but has since been downgraded to a 10 pack, which isn't as good of a value.  However, these are a great product overall.\n","id":"0d59aa25-b0a9-4578-9091-8abf798cd1ed"},{"text":"\n  Super cute.

You can use double sided tape to keep it in a cloth one, but I didn't find that necessary - they stay inside the mask just fine. It's important to keep them clean or I could see them causing breakouts on your face. I've found people can also hear me more clearly when speaking with a mask on when I use the brackets.

That was easy to fix by cutting off the top part of the bracket. The plastic was easy to modify with a pair of scissors and now I have my own custom fit. It no longer leaves a gap at the top and I can pinch the metal noseband on the mask snug.The structure still functions in keeping the mask from sucking in when I inhale.

This first part of the review is about both as they feel taste and smell the same,  they both change color with the pH of your skin. Love them!! Oh they go on so smooth and nice. They don't feel heavy or tacky, it don't have a weird smell or taste like so many name brand lipsticks. (I don't want to taste roses or whatever, yuck!)HELLO SAILOR:  The color for me went on a bit blue and then changed right away to a lovely raisin/rose shade. I'm a neutral to warm-toned gal, on whom warm colors turn orange, and cool colors turn blue (again, ick). This makes buying lipstick a pain. Based on other reviews and pictures (thanks for those!) I decided to give this a whirl. It's just the color I was looking for when wearing more cool-toned clothes like blues or purples. The smooth feel wears off after a while and there is a bit of color left as a sort of stain. That's really nice! Especially since I'm not always near my lipstick to apply right away. I've ordered two - one to keep in my purse and one to keep with my makeup.FROG PRINCE: My DD got this color (she's very pale with red hair) b/c she struggles with lipstick being too bright for her complexion. Many colors turn pink on her. She saw this and decided to try it. She absolutely loved the color. It looked so great on her I decided to try it as well. I'm so glad I did. It's a lovely shade of reddish rose w/o being garish in the least. I don't have the coloring to support that lovely bright red that looks fabulous on so many others. This is soft and simply gorgeous! I'm a convert. I will be getting a second one of these as well to keep with me. I couldn't be more happy.\n","id":"49bd254c-7590-489b-830d-7afb50f70d3f"},{"text":"\n  There are 3 reasons I adore this product:  First- it is navy blue lipstick.  How cool is that? Second-the color is \"Hello Sailor\".  Need I say more?  And last and by far the most important-the color is outstanding.  Very light-kind of a bluish pink.  Very flattering.  Also, the more coats you apply, the darker it gets.

I actually saw Hello Sailor demonstrated on a TV shopping network.  I decided to check Amazon and found it for less.  I was skeptical about the blue color, but saw how it changed after being applied.  It seemed to be different on everyone.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I really liked the pinkish/mauve/purple color it became.  Queen lipsticks are not long lasting, but sometimes that is fine for me.  I have another brand I like if I need something longer lasting.  I like it because it is creamy and goes on easily and has no scent.  I thought this was very reasonablly priced on Amazon.  I gave it four out of five starts only because it is not long lasting and needs to be reapplied frequently if you are eating or drinking.

I'm still getting used to them.  My other experience with lipstick tube pickups have all been on Danelectro guitars.  These Duncans are nothing like the Danos.They installed without a hitch.  They are a perfect sized replacement fit to a Fender single coil pickup.  Wiring is a good 3 wire (single coil - separate ground) and the cable itself has an aluminum foil shield that completely surrounds the two signal wires for the coil.I read reviews of them that described them as \"jangly.\"  They most definitely have a clarity in the top end that is surprising, but they are also really beefy sounding in the low end.  The most surprising was the bridge pickup, which does not have the almost shrill sound I'm used to hearing with stock Strats.The thing I found most striking about them is that they are very quiet, both hum-wise and mechanically.  Without pole pieces sticking out of the tops, if you happen to press a string against the pickup, there is no click.To my aging ear, these are a very mellow pickup, not unlike SD Quarter Pounders, which I have on a Telecaster.I don't delve into metal, but I doubt these would be satisfactory for a shredder, but for a jazz  or blues player, these are a very nice warm sounding pickup.  If you open the tone controls up on the guitar, they sound like they would handle a bit of country twang with ease.\n","id":"4950f48a-cbaa-4bab-add7-a0af67502751"},{"text":"\n  I placed this into the middle pickup of my Strat and it sounds great.  It has lots of lipstick chime and a good low end punch (more than I was expecting).  Installing the pickup was super simple.  It's also very quiet and produces less single coil hum than my previous middle pickup.  The RWRP makes the 2 and 4 positions humbucking.  It's not dead quiet in the humbucking position, but I think that's due to the fact that I have it mixed with other pickups with different output levels.  Overall I'm really glad I installed this. Because I kept the standard single coils in the neck and bridge, this lipstick really made the 2, 3 and 4 positions unique.  It gave my strat new life and a bunch of new tones to play with.\n","id":"c4af1f58-0335-484c-beac-cc1508380f6e"},{"text":"\n  does not sound at all like any lipstick pickup I have ever played.

I generally only keep lipstick on for 3-5 hours, but you would definitely need to reapply after a meal.\n","id":"bc6bac85-d0e5-4b8b-b16a-1bcbefcca9d2"},{"text":"\n  I bought this in the Bare All shade and was pleasantly surprised.

Something I don't love is that it's not cruelty free so I am looking for a replacement for it. I had hoped this would be it, but I just wasn't a fan of the color. The pictures showed it to be a brighter red than it was in person. I put it on and it was more of a brown red which I didn't like. I LOVE the formula of this though. It feels very comfortable on the lips and the gloss isn't sticky like other glosses I have used. I would love this so much if the red shade was more of a true red. I would  be interested to try other shades in the line because I do like the formula.\n","id":"483eb119-5bb2-4605-999c-6f0a8eb84e38"},{"text":"\n  Love this lipstick! As a very frequent user of chapstick, I have completely deconditioned my lips and am unable to use regular lipstick brands. My lips get super dry with drug store makeup and it ends up looking awful. This DID NOT happen with the PYT brand! No dryness and I didn’t feel like I had to put chapstick on under or over the color. The color was vibrant and stayed on all night with no fading.

They last all day for me, even after eating and drinking.Some things you need to know:1. The colors continue to get darker as they dry. (Compare product photo of wet lipstick to applied photo with dry lips)2. Extremely matte. The agent added for this effect is very drying, so be sure to exfoliate and moisturize before you apply, or you will see imperfections you didn't know existed on your lips.3. Applicator makes it difficult to create a straight edge (see photo, applied with provided applicator). You should use a liner (does not come with this set) and probably your own lipstick applicator brush to be more precise.When I purchased, the colors were Dazed, Bittersweet and Hudson. I love these colors for special occasions, but think they're too dark for everyday use. You can layer a brighter color on top and use every day, if you wish. The liquid lipstick will definitely stick.\n","id":"f5a3dabc-8408-488f-9e33-e68843c6b066"},{"text":"\n  I got two of the same color, so I was pretty disappointed.

So I was pretty bummed, and wish instead I had gotten the Kat Von Dee liquid lipstick and eyeliner combo that I was debating between. Even though they are sample/ miniature sizes, it ended up being a waste since I won't wear any of them. I bought mine 3 months ago, and the one time I wore one- I chose spice, I needed to reapply literally between leaving my house and getting to work. I hadn't eaten in between, I had been sipping on coffee, but not enough to warrant a new application- especially as I used a lip primer and had put a gloss over it. Super bummed.

It is compared to Sex and the City, and yes there is a bit of SATC-ish about it; but it's truly a great show on it's own. And- is it just me or whenever there is now a new show that has a strong female lead- is there not the inevitable comparison to SATC- either by the Public or the press? Moving on....Second- yes there is a short amount of episodes on this DVD- but it is because it's a mid-season replacement show- it did not debut with other shows in September. Plus- the year it came out- all the shows had been shut down because of the writer strike. So, yes, it's a first season; but people should know and understand that it's not the typical first season before they start taking stars off for shortness of season.Think of this season as the first season of Grey's Anatomy- which only had 9 episodes- was a mid-season replacement and STILL sells for 20 bucks on Amazon...The show:The show centers on the lives of Wendy, Nico, and Victory. Wendy is in a marriage with a husband that loves her and 2 children that wishes she was around a bit more. Wendy is a succesful woman- and is trying to do it all- be a wonderful mother and wife and have the glowing career.Nico is in a s-e-x less marriage. Her husband Charles does not pay attention to her or her needs.He does love her, though- but in a less passionate way than she wants. He's a bit of an alpha male- wanting Nico to conform to his idea of the perfect woman. Nico also works in the same corporation as Wendy- and is quite the business woman herself.Victory is younger than the other ones- has had a share of success, until her most recent fashion show and is still reeling from the critics. She is not married- and meets Joe Bennet- a wealthy man who wines and dines her and becomes a share holder in Victory Ford fashion.This show has sadly been cancelled by NBC, I beleive. The second season ended in February and I don't believe that it is being renewed for a 3rd season. Which is a crying shame- as that it truly is a good show- with a cast that is funny and plays well off one another.If you have read the book, the plot lines are similar; but the women in the book are older (or at least Victory in the book is- on the tv show, I believe Victory is in her late 20's/early 30's- but in the book, she is in her 40's)I think you should give the show a try for another smart and funny show. It was one of my favorite shows to watch in it's limited time on television\n","id":"d128b081-5b77-44b3-9701-d037c4b6011c"},{"text":"\n  I just finished watching the complete series of LIPSTICK JUNGLE on DVD and I wish that this series could have absolutely gone on FOREVER.  I never saw it on television as I had assumed that it was like Sex and the City, which never really was a favorite of mine.This series is SO GOOD that I swear that if I had the capital, I would reassemble the cast and produce it myself. The acting is SUPERB; the storyline is fresh; and it tells the beautiful tale of three friends.  I would kill to have long lasting friendships with women like that.When I look at the crap that is being shown on television right now, I have to ask \"WHAT are the executives thinking??\"  They yank really GREAT shows after 1 or 2 seasons (if not before!) and never really give them the chance to catch on.  I can definitely tell you that if I had even caught one episode of this great series while it was on the air, it would have been TiVoed each week!I believe that everyone involved in this production should feel enormously PROUD to have been affiliated with such a great show.

I have seen some unworthy shows stay on for long periods of time.

I'd seen all the casts interviews on Today so long ago and couldn't wait to watch this.  Because in Australia we yet again don't keep up with the rest of the world, I bought this on dvd and it was as good as I thought it would be.  I really love Candice Bushnall and she didn't disappoint with this series.Brooke plays Wendy Healy, Kim is Nico and Lindsay is Victory.  They are longtime friends who are challenged with keeping up with complicated business and personal lives.  Wendy is a film executive and a wife to a musician husband Shane whose own career takes a backseat to hers.  Victory had a top notch fashion career that she's trying to start again.  And lastly Nico who's the editor of a top fashion magazine and her marriage has issues too.  That's the main premise and with each episode we see their lives go through ups and downs professionally and personally.When my copy arrived, I watched it all in one weekend.  It's addictive and I found it really enjoyable.  Victory is my favourite character and yet they all make the show.  I don't think there is one particular stand out role.  This is a great new program that you'll really enjoy if you loved SATC.  It's different and yet just as good and I hope it gets the same kind of longevity.

Didn’t want too flashy but cute enough to carry casually. I must say I have only had this bag for a short while but it’s super cute & good quality. Nice quality canvas, tote handles are reinforced so it can hold some weight. Has a removable lap top padded insert and several zippers and pocket/pen areas. There are also outside pockets on each side of the tote. One outside pocket is wide enough for a iPad and the other pocket is wide enough foe a iPad mini. Overall very please with this buy.**If you found this review helpful, please take a moment and hit the button below and let Amazon know!

I bought it for my chrome, but it will fit a regular sized laptop, no problem. There are several interior pockets and 2 exterior pockets. The color is a neutral grey/tan, which coordinates with just about everything. It is a sturdy bag, the cushioning is minimal, but I don't plan on  using it as checked luggage, so it will be just fine. My current bag has the laptop pocket on the outside, which I do not like because it can be easily stolen, this one has it in the middle of the bag, behind a velcro enclosure and the main zipper, which I feel is pretty secure and hidden. If you are looking for a classy casual laptop purse, this is a well made affordable option\n","id":"3c289765-418a-446a-81b5-c848ff782f00"},{"text":"\n  Love having a sturdy bag that can stay packed with the essentials and flex from a suit to the pool I have used it to carry a laptop AND a Surface Pro plus a hefty planner and it holds a lot.

I also really appreciate the strong straps (probably because I tend to overstuff it) which are comfortable.Update: one more reason to love this bag! No idea why I put some fast food packet in it “for later” (yeah not a good idea) which of course burst all over everything. I washed the bag in the washer on gentle and dried inside out!

I have Wicked and wanted something even deeper and Bloodmoon is exactly what I was looking for. It applies perfectly and is completely opaque and quick drying. It doesn’t crack if your lips are properly prepared beforehand and lasts for hours without needing to be reapplied. Now older tubes of Lime Crime are slightly different than the newer ones: older tubes don’t have the rose on top and have a short doe foot applicator and the sticker on the bottoms have slightly different color and font so if it looks a bit different it’s not fake it’s just an older tube. The very first time I bought a Velvetine I purchased it from the official website 3 years ago so I can tell you the slight differences definitely does not mean you were swindled, Doe Deere just “upgraded” her packaging so don’t worry. This is the only authorized Lime Crime seller on Amazon as listed and linked to on the official Lime Crime website all products are authentic but if your purchased from other sellers not listed you may have purchased a knock-off just beware and only purchase from official sellers and you’ll be fine.\n","id":"fe0f351c-3832-45b9-aeed-3588e8ac430d"},{"text":"\n  I have the velvetines in two other colors, Shroom (matte warm brown) and Eclipse (maroon metallic with gold reflect). Both of the colors I already had are extremely long wearing and comfortable; petal soft texture and finish, good pigment, consistent formula throughout. As a makeup artist I always judge liquid lip brands on their darkest/most difficult to make colors, because that's where the true expertise shines. I bought Bloodmoon (deep burgundy) to put Limecrime to the test, and this dark is definitely satisfactory. It's a bit patchy and slightly crumbly when layered; however, I suggest patting/lightly gliding it on starting with small areas because it does dry rather quickly. All in all it's pretty easy to make these lippies work for you.\n","id":"251f70b4-dfa7-4e42-9ad5-c3a8ccd40922"},{"text":"\n  The color is freaking beautiful (pic below). I've been looking for this color for years and hopes were high because it seemed like it was quality being 20 dollars, and the description. To find that and cruelty free was a dream. A dream that turned into a nightmare when it smears everywhere if a light breeze touches it. Ok, thats an exaggeration. I did want to love this. Unfortunately it does smear when even slightly touched so eating is an impossible task(it got all over my hand eating some peanuts, pic below), and kissing (even just a peck) your significant other at all is a no without both parties having marks every where. I tried different methods of application, and preparation to my lips to see if I could figure it out but no. Even putting it on, it smeared in different places. I had to clean up the rest of my make up 4 times.I thought I'd spend 20 bucks on this, and I'm usually the elf and wet n wild cheap make up person, so I feel very jipped. The cheap ones do a much better job. I'm disappointed.

(a company authorized by the estate of the late movie and cable TV director, Zalman King) has finally rereleased \"Zalman King's Red Shoe Diaries:  Another Woman's Lipstick\" onto DVD.  The rarely-seen segment in the anthology film, entitled, \"Just Like That\", starring Nina Siemaszko and Matt LeBlanc (from the classic NBC ensemble sitcom, \"Friends\", in one of his first acting roles), is included in its entirety, complete and uncensored.  The sex scene in the elevator between Siemaszko and LeBlanc is hot and erotic.  It is a softcore porn classic.  The bedroom sex scenes between them are also hot and erotic.  Nina Siemaszko does an magnificent job faking an orgasm during the bedroom scene when she is on top of LeBlanc.  It is among the best facial orgasmic responses in the history of softcore film and video, and is comparable to the work of Harlee McBride in the two \"Young Lady Chatterley\" films.There are some drawbacks to this product that are unrelated to the content of this \"made for premium cable TV\" film.  The video disc was manufactured as a \"DVD-R\" video disc, instead of \"DVD Video\" video disc.  If your DVD player or recorder does not play DVD-R video discs, you won't be able to watch the program.  Check your owner's manual to make sure that your device can play this product.  Also, this video disc is a \"bare bones\" product.  There are no main menus, no still photos, no alternate commentary tracks from the director or the stars, and no \"making of\" documentaries on the video disc.  When you load the video disc, the movie will begin to start playing.  You can skip from chapter to chapter on your own, but the editing between chapters is not always seemless.  For example, when skipping to Chapter 3, the viewer is sent to the elevator sex scene midway through the scene.  It would have been better if the chapter had started when Siemaszko and LeBlanc both had entered the elevator. and started the next chapter after the scene had ended. Also, the audio is in mono, and not available in Stereo.  That is a shame, because there is some great soundtrack music on this film.It has been close to 20 years since \"Red Shoe Diaries:  Another Woman's Lipstick\" was released onto home video in 1993.  I am very thankful that this rare, hard-to-find\" made-for-premium-cable-TV movie is finally available for sale in some form on DVD for viewers in North America to enjoy.  Despite the problems with the product itself, \"Red Shoe Diaries:  Another Woman's Lipstick\" is all here in its uncensored, uncut glory.  I highly recommend that you buy this DVD-R video disc if it indeed can be played on your DVD player or recorder.  You won't be disappointed.\n","id":"134a5ab1-a8ca-4689-8d12-b28b612bd698"},{"text":"\n  An erotic movie that tries to be art but falls short.\n","id":"793616b1-df3d-4eed-96f7-07072d2db34c"},{"text":"\n  good\n","id":"cfbefe73-8e4f-46b5-a2a4-455699a81a04"},{"text":"\n  Absolutely Love the Series and Excellent reproduction of the original Tapes.\n","id":"175a91e7-8bcc-4dd0-aee2-88698142d110"},{"text":"\n  its ok.  did not finish watching it.  that's ok, too\n","id":"6ae0c7bd-9b27-4bee-a6fd-71a027cb6b43"},{"text":"\n  The item is well received.

I have an eleven-month-old daughter, and this toy looked very much like something I would have loved as a kid. I also think it's cute as an adult, but I love things that are traditionally associated with femininity. So I was a little worried about getting this and pushing my love of pink and frill onto my baby (which, you know, is kind of not really relevant at this age since all she is doing is trying to eat it, but here I am anyway). But it had the mirror, and my baby loves her visage. So I ordered it, and it's not bad. It has some educational components, (round lipstick, square powder puff, alphabet, etc). It has a couple of modes - singing, pretend, and one other that I can't recall (educational?). It tells her she looks \"marvelous\" and says \"ooo la la\" and stuff like that, which some people may not like because it focuses on external appearance. At this age, obviously, my baby doesn't know WTF the thing is saying, and when she does understand, I think there are worse things in life than having a toy vanity tell you that you look marvelous. It is not an especially annoying toy, either, even when she activates the same song over and over and over and over again. I mean, I'm not going to rush out and buy the album, but it could be much worse. Interestingly, she does not seem overly excited about the mirror. I think it distorts a little bit.Overall, I highly recommend this toy. Very cute, not too annoying, fun for babies and (hopefully because I don't want to have to buy more toys) toddlers.\n","id":"1021e8ee-3787-470d-89d3-20f38da7f976"},{"text":"\n  I would have given this five stars because the mirror is absolutely beautiful and the music is lovely however this item was described and portrayed with advertisement photos to come with all of the accessories as in the display photos the advertisement pictures show all of the accessories that go in place to make the music when you put the items in each spot however it does not come with any of the accessories shown the lipstick the Powder Puff the comb and the bracelet are missing and it just comes with the mirror only and the compact that is attached to the mirror which if it wasn't attached to the mirror would not come with it I Can Only Imagine anything that is not physically attached to the item wouldn't have came with it and I am very disappointed with this because now I have to individually purchase the items or buy them used to replace them for this item to give it to my daughter for her first birthday so she has a complete set I'm not going to just give her one item with all of the pieces missing when she opens it on her birthday this is why I am going to say do not buy this item unless you want just the mirror. I also don't know where they got the item from because it was not in its original packaging given the accessories are all missing and it came in just a plain brown Amazon cardboard box it is supposed to be in a Fisher-Price packaging like the originals but I do know that this item was from 2014 so it may have been back stock from somewhere but they should let you know before purchase that the items are all missing accessories that are supposed to be included will not be included and it is the mirror only that you are purchasing\n","id":"4cde28bc-9187-41f5-aabd-2fa48f83af5c"},{"text":"\n  I can not speak to the quality of the item inside as it was a gift.

I'm having trouble finding my favorite, \"go to\" color (Call the Shots), so I thought I might try this one (Hustler).Not only is the color darker than I thought it would be, it has something in it that dries your lips. It's not the formula I'm accustomed too as a Bare Minerals customer. And it's not something I would recommend. This color has a bit of a bronze like metallic look to it. Whatever that is might be what is in it that dries your lips. It won't blend either, not like the formula I'm used to. Someone else might like it, but not me.I won't be getting this color again. Sadly, (ugh), I may have to look for a new lipstick if they stopped making Call The Shots.

I have the colors Loyal, Committed and Charming. Loyal is a bright true red, Committed is a dusty pinky nude shade with a sliiight coral undertone, and Charming is a deep mauve that can work for day or night.The formula is soft and has almost a whipped like texture. Seriously, of all the Matte liquids I've tried, theBalm's Meet Matte has the best application. I never get those hard lines I get with other liquid mattes, and it's very easy to apply.The colors are wearable, vibrant, and they are completely transfer proof after they dry. Not only are they transfer proof, they don't budge. You can eat and drink without anything moving. Although depending what you're eating (say a burger) the middle can fade a bit. The wear time is absolutely incredible. I rarely ever have to reapply when I'm wearing this lipstick.Unlike most matte formulas I have tried, I find this to be the smoothest and the one that makes my lips look the least aged. I'm 33 and certain mattes really make my lips look much older than they are. Even with the bright red, I don't have any settling into the lines of my lips. This in of itself is a complete win in my book.It's also the most comfortable matte liquid to wear, IMO. It's lightweight and doesn't feel like my lips are slathered in dry paint after it sets.It doesn't taste like anything. They have a minty candy like scent that I find totally yummy. When you apply it you get a very subtle mint type of feeling that dissapates after it sets. I love it, some may not, and some may not notice it. The scent also dissipates after the lipstick sets.Upon first inspection you may think the formula looks chunky, but it applies like a dream. It's kind of weird that is looks like it's chunky but it's not, not really.I'd buy these again in a heartbeat. If you're looking for a high quality liquid matte with amazing staying power, amazing color payoff and pigmentation, that doesn't make your lips look like the Crypt Keeper...try this.\n","id":"0ad55a64-6d8f-4751-9b1c-d23266953b71"},{"text":"\n  Absolutely the best formulation for matte lipstick I've tried. I love the wand, the color, the packaging, the smell, the staying power, the way it feels on my lips. It is dry but it dries SOFT not hard and it doesn't cause my lips to shrivel up. I love this. I haven't shut up about it for 3 weeks. I have a drawer full of lip products and this k my favorite!!I'm a nurse and I work 12+ hours. I only touch up ONCE in my shift (after I eat lunch). Drinking coffee and water doesn't affect the wear.\n","id":"6305389d-8355-49a2-90df-ccd6abc1e3f0"},{"text":"\n  This color exceeded my expectations. As a lover of pink, this was out of my comfort zone, but once I had it on with a black dress I felt gorgeous. This is one of those shades that I think would look stunning on anyone.

Application was trying for me, I think it would have been easier had I had a matching liner, but it took quite some time to get a perfect line. I threw it in my bag for a long night out, nervous about it cracking or wearing off but even after 6 hours without touch ups, the rest of me was a mess but my lips were flawless.\n","id":"77ca4811-429b-4a04-b368-a93a7abc6526"},{"text":"\n  I have almost all the other shades and absolutely love this one!

Not real.  Letters are darker too. Second, the product, although smells the same, does not act at all the same!  It went on greasy and took forever to dry, then it wore off within 20 minutes. I applied it three times and with a pencil and it wore away fast. Also the color is more transparent and it was redder in color, rather than a mauve. Bummed!!

I own these in Pink Pop, Shocking Coral, Electric Fuchsia (LE), Vivid Rose, Hot Plum, and Brazen Berry. These are the best drugstore lipsticks that I have ever used. They are longwearing, and are very creamy, with an almost balm-like feel. I have extremely dry lips, but these are so moisturizing that I can wear them with no problems. All of the shades have a shiny, cream finish, with no shimmer.The shades are as follows:Pink Pop: A very opaque and white-based bubblegum pink. I don't find that it goes on streaky, however, in spite of the color. For a light shade, this has a considerable amount of punch to it. This color is my second favorite.Shocking Coral: This is an almost day-glo coral that leans more pink than orange. This shade is just one step away from neon, but I think that it's still a very pretty spring color.Electric Fuchsia (LE): I actually ordered the shade Fuchsia Flash, but I received the limited edition shade Electric Fuchsia. The difference between the two colors is almost imperceptible, so I kept it. Electric Fuchsia is perhaps a tiny bit darker and more blue-based than Fuchsia Flash. This is a very bright, what some call \"Barbie,\" pink.Vivid Rose: This is a true, bright, pink-red, akin to the petals of a red rose. I find this shade to be cooler, with a blue base that causes it to lean towards more of a rich, deep pink than red. When I use the word deep, don't mistake that to mean dark. This is still a saturated, bright, knock-your-socks-off kind of color. As much as I love this color though, it does tend to bleed in the Cupid's bow of my upper lip. I'm 28, and have no visible fine lines around my lips, but the color does migrate. However, I think a good clear liner might remedy this problem.Hot Plum: This is a really pretty purple that is slightly warmer than the other purple in this collection. It is more of a pink-purple. This is a very nice shade, and because of its pink lean, it would perhaps be less scary to those that are hesitant to try a purple lip.Brazen Berry: The only word I have for this is LOVE. This is my favorite color of the collection, and it is a true, blue-based purple. It has a formulation that is a little sheerer than the other colors, but it is very buildable. In daylight, this color is stunning. This is a statement-lip kind of shade, and not for the faint of heart.\n","id":"89acbb4c-a264-4287-9d99-2462b9748e32"},{"text":"\n  The color is beautiful but I have to add some lip balm, otherwise: 1. the finish won't be very nice and your lips will look veeeery dry 2.

What I should expect for something so inexpensive?✫Funnily enough, it's considerably softer than the pricier Pro Wet n Wild tapered blending brush (which is beautifully shaped but scratchy).✫ It does a decent enough job at blending out the crease, but its irregular cut makes it hard to achieve anything close to precision.✫It is NOT a good brush for applying color to the crease as the bristles are too sparse and poorly shaped for that.✫I understand that in the realm of brushes this is as affordable as it gets; but if you can manage just a little more I've found the Coastal Scents BR-250 Pro Blending Fluff to be a great option for those not wanting to invest in the MAC 217 or Sigma e25.\n","id":"53841840-38be-463d-ad4c-6c7936c41eec"},{"text":"\n  This is seriously such an amazing steal for the price- go buy it now!!! I got this for about $1 as an add-on item, and it is an amazing price for this brush, as I am very familiar with the quality of the Wet N Wild brushes. They are all fantastic quality (extremely soft, no shedding or fallout) and this one is no exception, and for the price it is an almost unbelievable deal!This contour brush has many uses- as contour (obviously) but since it’s bristles are dense, also for blush, highlight, or precise powder placement. I personally love tapered brushes like these for blush or use with any cheek product as I’ve found the shape to apply makeup in the most natural way. Also different sides of the tapered brush can be used for different purposes (the tip for precise placement of product, the sides for light placement of color, and the bristle part to apply blush/bronzer/contour on cheeks).I’m so happy I stumbled upon this on Amazon, as I already owned the foundation brush from the same collection but bought it months ago at Walgreens for about $10. Still a good deal for a good brush, but not as good as $1.Just to make these even better, ALL THESE BRISHES ARE CRUELTY-FREE, GLUTEN-FREE, AND VEGAN!Pick this up while it is still available!!![FYI: I am just a regular customer who purchased this brush and did not receive any discount or incentive for my review.

It's not dense and it's quite soft. I didn't see how it would apply any color. This is not the brush to use for light, natural color blushes. However, it's perfect for dark, pigmented, statement blushes. I used I with Milani Baked Blush in Delizioso (purple toned fuchsia) and got the prettiest gentle pink on my fair skin. It blended very well with no patches. Using a more dense brush would have left me looking like a clown. So I'm very happy to add this brush to my collection.

He uses any and all means necessary to do this, including hidden cameras, hidden microphones, and 24 hour surveillance.  He has complete control most of the time, and absolute authority to find the information he needs in order to protect the United States against foreign interests that may try to undermine the government by stealing precious secrets.That being said, this movie plays out like a cheesy 70's TV melodrama.  I tried hard to like this movie, but it was a hard sell.  The movie starts out with multiple explosions at some facility, and one character managing to make it out before the whole place goes up.  We see this character running down a corridor, being chased by other individuals, and then the picture freezes at a dramatic moment to allow for a credit to be displayed on the screen.  This happens about four or five more times, and becomes quite tiresome, but if I recall, this was a device used quite a bit in the 70's, on movie but more so on TV.  This movie really has a 'TV' feel to it, so I am wondering if the director was primarily a TV director...well, I was right.  The director is Lamont Johnson, and he has an extensive career directing TV, and it shows here.  Anyway, one character escapes before the whole place goes blammo, and it's Michael Sarrazin playing Welles.  This is one of those actors who you may not recognize the name, but you'd probably recognize his face.  He was fairly popular in the late 60's through the 70's.  This slender, dark haired actor seemed to be on the verge of becoming a major star, but has since been relegated to mostly TV roles.Well, he escapes, and we find out later that he was the only survivor of the explosion.  His face badly damaged from the explosions, he manages to make it to the house of Nicole, played by Christine Belford, and actress with a solid television background and a few parts in some features films.  The role I remember her from was the over protective mother to Arnie Cunningham in John Carpenter/Stephen King's killer car classic 'Christine' from 1983.  We soon find out that that Welles, the soul survivor of the explosions, was also the one who caused the explosions.  Apparently he used false credentials to get his position within the ultra top secret facility, then stole vital information, and caused the destruction of the facility to cover his escape.  He remembers none of this, as he has lost his memory along with his face in the incident.  We learn all this information from Tuxan, who is now investigating the situation.  There is a conspiracy, and it does follow though.  The rest of the movie has Welles trying to put the pieces back together, recall what happened, if he could have killed those people and done the things Tuxan says he did.  Nicole provides a haven for Welles, and seems sympathetic to his plight.The movie plays out, the conspiracy unfolds, and we are treated to a shocking ending.  Well, not so shocking, really, but whatever.  It was kind of hard to swallow, though.  My main problem with this movie is I never really felt the tension that should have been there and the acting seemed kind of wooden.  I enjoy a good conspiracy theory, but I had a hard time buying off on this one.  The thing to keep in mind before you buy this movie is that it looks like a TV show.  This was made in 1972, and prior to that, George Peppard had a somewhat promising movie career with Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), How the West Was Won (1962), and The Blue Max (1966) to name a few.  Then around 1971, the movie roles seemed to dry up and he went into TV.  He did make a number of movie after 1971, Damnation Alley (1977), Battle Beyond the Stars (1977), but none seemed to really have the prestige of previous movie roles.  The same could be said for Michael Sarrazin.  And the other main character, played by Christine Belford was primarily a TV actress.  Given the director's history in TV, this all adds up to making this look like a high budget TV movie.  I think once some directors immerses themselves in a particular medium, it's difficult to expand beyond the boundaries proscribed by that medium, and it shows here.  I felt like the director was trying to exceed his grasp, and couldn't quite do it.  Not a bad movie, for TV, but not a great movie for the big screen.  I'd say 3 stars for a TV movie, 2½ stars for a theatrical release.Cookieman108\n","id":"90b21b2d-8fad-4f86-a174-8a75d4d4c561"},{"text":"\n  The Groundstar Conspiracy is a peculiar hybrid of A-movie plot, effects and suspense and B-movie acting, music and occasionally editing. The story is intriguingly complicated (close to being far-fetched, but nevertheless): the twist and turns never cease to amaze the viewer. The same thing goes for the execution of the action scenes (great pyrotechnics during the opening scene) and the setting, with its fine locations (sci-fi-style research institute, villa near the beach, harbour area, helicopter views of the surroundings). All this together breathes quality and manages to secure and retain the viewer's attention right till the end (where I was wrong-footed for one moment, until ...). Unfortunately, some of the interesting action scenes are edited so tightly you've almost missed them while blinking your eyes. The crucial blast that sets off the whole affair is over before you realized what you've been looking at (mixing it with the opening credits doesn't help either), similar to the scene in which the intruder in the clinic is pursued and killed (again, before you've even had the time to realize what has happened). There are some minor examples of such overhasty editing too (the accident in the ambulance, the capture of Welles' (Michael Sarrazin) kidnappers preceded by Welles' escape). Another nagging point is the music used in this film: true, it is varied, but some of it is somewhat exaggerated and cheap because of that. This is true to some point of the music used during the romantic interlude between Welles and Nicole (Christine Belford), but mainly of the odd sci-fi music including beeping sounds etc. It tends to draw too much undeserved attention to itself, making the events on the screen seem less serious than they are (I remember similar music being used in The Anderson Tapes). A last critical remark I would like to make is about the style of acting. It appeared to me (especially in the beginning) that the actors tended to sort of rattle off their lines, without making it sound all too convincing. Towards the end, this seemed to improve. Perhaps I just had to get used to them (Peppard is a very good actor, after all). As to the scenes between Welles and Nicole, I had some initial doubts too: I felt she confided in a total stranger far too easily. This seeming rather unrealistic, I drew up the theory she was part of some sort of a setup. When it turned out she was not, I began to appreciate her relevance to the plot anyway, considering she was the one who helped Welles on the way to recover his memory. The Groundstar Conspiracy is an amusing suspense thriller with some flaws, but it is definitely entertaining enough to please the viewer.\n","id":"346d4ec5-f963-49f2-82e7-f7388b8835f9"},{"text":"\n  Torture, rendition, holding people without access to lawyers, all the things we see now are used in this thriller about a spy stealing secrets from the US and how a shadowy organization uses and abuses anyone it wants to get its way, regardless of who is hurt.

It is not one solid pillow, it is more like a lumpy donut.\n","id":"195e653c-12e6-469b-8367-21d53917cfbd"},{"text":"\n  Good quality bag, just what I expected.

I can breathe! Highly recommend!\n","id":"bd5f7db0-ceac-4f93-afab-0b2043816882"},{"text":"\n  This is my second type of insert. These are soft and fit great. They ergonomic and the little dived inside help control glass from fogging. Helps, does not stop. I am personally not a fan because it is so soft. To me it could be a bit more firm. The best feature is the loops for the strings. This keeps it in place when you take it off. The other brand I have does not have this and even though I prefer it more it fall out if I don't remember. So the loops are great on this one!\n","id":"ca567931-950c-400c-b507-eb2862500c3d"},{"text":"\n  The smaller size is fine for me but, not my husband. Easy to use with my homemade mask.\n","id":"b98e538a-a5de-4026-be15-7dac6f532f88"},{"text":"\n  Good, can improve it by having a top flap or hook where the bracket can slip on the mask to prevent mask from sliding up and bracket sliding down this help secure it better when you speak all this mask bracket need the top hook or slip  and make some black color that would match me work mask that are black\n","id":"e29fc435-e55d-46f1-8a96-0da7ec25e9d2"},{"text":"\n  Fits well and helps prevent breathing in mask cloth. However it will still get moist under the mask and you'll notice the moisture on the silicone frame.  Feels fine against the skin otherwise.  Packaging is nice. It will fold flat unlike the other 3d frames.  Also no worry of loosing it since it has the loops to go around mask as traps.  Overall worth the purchase if you tend to suck in your mask.\n","id":"3dd1c5c1-205b-48c6-b6c6-23973e3dfe39"},{"text":"\n  This is my favorite, everyday lipstick. I keep a tube in my purse, in the kitchen and in the bathroom for frequent touch ups throughout the day. It has a perfect pale, slightly frosty, pearly sheen; nothing too harsh or sparkly.
