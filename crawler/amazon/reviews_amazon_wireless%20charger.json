Granted, this is mostly my fault, since I failed to read the fine print and simply purchased a \"qi wireless charger\" to use with my new phone. I don't blame Anker for this, quite the opposite: I actually blame Google, who have locked down wireless Rapid Charging and are only allowing their own dock to use Rapid Charging technology. This is the same anti-consumer garbage in which Apple has long engaged (though ironically not with these Qi Wireless chargers; go figure), and I'm disappointed to see Google fall to its lure as well. But I digress.This particular Anker unit charges my phone, albeit \"slowly\". The real problem, however, is that the charger seems nearly wholly incompatible with the Pixel in specific. It says it's charging the phone but my battery continues to drain at the same rate as if it weren't docked at all. Furthermore, it has serious stability issues; I'll leave my phone docked for a few minutes and it all-of-a-sudden loses connection and halts charging the phone despite my not having touched the dock or the phone. Very disappointing.I've actually purchased another Qi Wireless Charging Stand of a different make (made by LK), and while it displays that it charges \"slowly\" like this Anker unit does, it actually DOES charge my phone and features none of the connectivity issues the Anker unit does. I'm not sure if this is due to a different design, or what, but this Anker unit is nothing more than a paperweight, which is disappointing. I would expect it at the very least to charge my phone, and I could even live with a slow charging rate if it was something I could set my phone on while I work. Seeing as it fails to do even that, it is basically an expensive paperweight, and I've actually just thrown it in the trash.This could have been avoided had I paid more attention to the fine print or done my research beforehand, so rather than 1-star I typically give to a useless product, I'll give Anker 3-stars so I don't drag the product rating down too much. By all accounts it seems a fine product for other devices, but buyers need to be warned before falling into the same trap I have an purchasing it for their Pixel phone.12/23/18 Edit: An Anker customer service representative reached out to my on their own account after seeing this review, offered me a full refund, AND offered to ship me a Google Pixel fast charger free of charge once they release. I've bought Anker charging units in the past and I'd continue to do so with confidence. Impressive customer service. If you have an iphone or another phone with which this charging unit works I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it.

I tried a different brand of standup charger that had an annoying fan in it that would spin up the second you put the phone on it. The Anker stand just does its job quietly and quickly with a soft blue circle light to tell you it's charging. I also prefer the stand-up model vs. the pad ones.

Most of the cheaper ones do not come with a power adapter, though.  When you add in the cost of a decent quality power adapter that supplies enough power for fast charging, you've spent almost as much.The Mophie has a premium look and feel.  It feels like a solid piece of aluminum, covered in a rubberized plastic.  The cord is not going to pull this off the desk/table, and, your phone is not going to slide off.  If you take the phone off while it is charging, it feels a little warm, but definitely not hot.  Also, once the phone is fully charged, the Mophie stops charging, and the phone is completely cool when you pick it up.Then there is the fact that I don't like to mess around with cheap stuff when it comes to charging.  Too many things can go wrong.Many other Qi chargers have bright LED's.  I wanted something to put on my night stand, so I didn't want any bright lights.  The Mophie has one, very small LED on the underside of it's curved edge that barely casts a glow on the surface underneath it.  Perfect for the bedroom.Plus, it's not finnicky about phone placement.  Just set the phone down so that the middle-ish area of the back of the phone is on the charger, and it charges.I added some photos to show the discreet charging indicator LED.

(However, I mostly charge at night and use \"Do Not Disturb\" so I don't get any notifications while charging.) I see that some reviewers have complained of early failures; however, this charger is warranted by Mophie for two years, so I consider that early failure should not be a big problem.The hardest part about buying a wireless charger was picking the right one. If you ask Siri to give you some reviews, she will give you several reviews from reputable sources--TheWireCutter, MacWorld, Macrumors, etc. But guess what, almost all of these reviews list a different top pick. So I used my \"musts and wants\" to come up with my short list:1. Had to be black or a dark color and a pad or a convertible.2. Had to be Qi-certified.3. Did not have to be the fastest charger, but did need to have a 7.5 watt or better output.4. The look/design had to appeal to me.5. Did not have to be the cheapest, but I did steer away from the most expensive.6. Needed to come with a wall adapter.Based on these criteria, I came up with the following for my short list: the Samsung convertible stand/pad, the Spigen F306W, and two Mophie pads-the newer model called the Charge Stream Pad+ and this one, which is about $15 cheaper than the Charge Stream Pad+.

I'm starting this review this way because traveling forces you to be efficient and practical. The more moving parts you travel with, the more the possibility one, or all may be left behind. Yes. I have even left home without my bags. Because of lessons from the past, I now tend to want to group things into specific areas in the room in order to avoid leaving anything behind. This has been a challenge with the plethora of technologies I travel with. In the past, because of the endless variants of chargers, and cables I needed to a) charge my iphone, b) charge my ear buds, c) charge my smart watch, d) charge my ipad, e)my laptop, f) sonicare... etc. I've had to build a small bag with an endless collection of all possible chargers for all possible occasions and emergencies. Recently, I upgraded to an iphone 11 and my main concern was how can I find a WIRELESS charger that could charge the most amount of products in the least amount of space, using the least about of wires, and with the least amount of dollars. After searching on amazon, I finally decided upon Slicecharge. It seemed compact, simple, well designed, and most importantly easy to travel with. There were other variants from other companies that more or less had the same set up, but the movable iwatch charge port (you can angle it) was perfect for me because I have a watch band that is a loop which doesn't come undone. And this small circle solves the problem of the strap. Other things I like are the magnetized watch port (it secures the watch to insure charging) as well as uses a new technology called “Full-area Charging”. I'm going to travel tomorrow. I cannot wait to use it there. I'm sure I'll be at peace knowing that my technology is quickly and fully charged... and more importantly that no thing will be left behind.\n","id":"d8eb3ad3-ac40-4c99-b0bc-1980cf43ce78"},{"text":"\n  I ordered this to use flat and not with the stand part that I didn’t even open.

This is now my updated one. This worked great with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple Watch 4, and AirPods 2. I got an amazing deal on AirPods Pro so I decided to give my AirPods 2 away and upgrade. Well this thing will not charge my AirPods Pro at all. Not with all three devices on it not by themselves. I was really hoping this would since Qi standard is a thing, but it doesn’t. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE AIRPODS PRO. This is a great charger if you have AirPods 2 though. Time to find a new all in one charger.Right now I am giving it a 5 star review without having used it yet. The base of the charger is slick plastic and unless you use the stand, it will probably not stay in one place. Luckily all you need is an exacto-knife and you can change this. On the bottom of the included stand is a piece of black rubber with a sticky back. It is only attached to do thin pieces of plastic in a crossing pattern. Very easy to peel off. Still extremely adhesive. Just pop that bad boi on the bottom of the charger. Note. You need to have the watch part raised before doing this. Then just cut out the hole carefully so you don’t hit the wire for the watch charger. Obviously this makes the stand unusable because it blocks the stand’s attachment points with the charger, but you wouldn’t be doing this if you were gonna use the stand. Attached is my pics of it.\n","id":"b12ff32a-03c4-474c-a834-5f03797dbba2"},{"text":"\n  I have both an iPhone and watch.I used around flat induction charger for the phone and apple charger on a stalk for the watch.The induction charger for the phone,being flat,made it impossible see the phone when used as a bedside charger and the phone had to be placed just so to attach.The watch frequently failed to attach and it was difficult to tell when either one was actually attached to its charger.This hard Cider Labs charger solved both problem with the Stand.It attaches instantly to both devices and its vertical orientation makes the phone easily accessible without picking it up.it is certainly an expensive option but well worth it for reliable and effortless charging.I liked it so much I bought a second one for my new residence.\n","id":"e40e46dc-7c15-4d10-8771-4b1f4e4e5cdd"},{"text":"\n  Everything about this charger is great, in theory.

It's visibly indistinguishable from a legacy cable so you may want to mark it. When it comes to fast charging over USB, most legacy USB cables won't work.  Using this Yootech charger and a quality QC compliant power adapter, I can't get it to fast charge with several of my legacy cables.  I assume the charger or the power adapter can sense if the cable is compliant or not. Bottom line is you'll need to use this cable or another one that meets the QC standard if you intend to wirelessly fast charge an iPhone or any of the 10W Android phones that the seller lists.ADAPTERS: An adapter is NOT supplied with the Yootech charger.  To support fast charging rates listed, you'll need a QC 2.0/3.0 power adapter rated at 15W or higher. I've tested the following adapters and verified that they'll fast charge an iPhone 8 Plus with the Yootech charger/cable. Please note that the battery needs to be below 80% to fast charge.  Above that level Apple apparently switches to a 5W standard charging rate to preserve battery life.

Keep in mind I get up from my desk frequently and the phone goes with, but it's been very nice to be able to just lay it on the charger each time I return instead of having to reconnect it to a cord every time (which I am guilty of forgetting to do often). Having the phone constantly regaining charge is a big necessity for me as I use it very often throughout the day and tend to burn the power down quickly.

I also had the older version of the Samsung dual charging station but I had the same issue. Samsung needs to improve how they charge their watches . Most of us use covers on our watches to protect our investment. The covers should not affect the charge. Nonetheless, I tried shifting the watch, moving around on the charging spot, leaving it there for a while, and nothing worked (with and without the watch cover). at first I thought it was defective with my older version of the Samsung dual.

Both will charge well through their respective covers. However, to ensure they are both \"connected\", I find it is best to place the one in the thicker (Otterbox) cover on first --listen for the \"bong sound\" from the phone to indicate it is charging--then place the other phone (in the thinner cover) next to it. If you do it in reverse order, the one in the Otterbox cover may not connect.

The charger is noisy...like, a supersonic, high-pitched noise starts happening when the phone is charging. At night, when all is quiet, it's very audible. I can even hear it when I'm watching movies in bed. I have two of these chargers, and they both do it. Also, the phone gets pretty hot when it is charging. Heat = death to electronics, which makes me nervous. Anyway, now you know everything!\n","id":"6318e194-da7d-4ea3-8630-760e22068a52"},{"text":"\n  I'm very disappointed with this charger because it's great for my Galaxy S8 and S10. However, playing my watch on pad is a constant struggle to find a sweet spot for the charge to be steady and consistent. Typically it turns on and off. I tried taking off the cover for my watch that did not help. I took off the straps to that did not help at all . I don't know what else to do except return it . I also had the older version of the Samsung dual charging station but I had the same issue. Samsung needs to improve how they charge their watches . Most of us use covers on our watches to protect our investment. The covers should not affect the charge. Nonetheless, I tried shifting the watch, moving around on the charging spot, leaving it there for a while, and nothing worked (with and without the watch cover). at first I thought it was defective with my older version of the Samsung dual. Then I returned that one and I got the Samsung duo 2.0 and the same problem existed. the concept is nice but the bottom line is the Samsung duo is inefficient for a good strong and steady charge on the Galaxy smartwatches. I'll returning the product today!\n","id":"c28be1bc-35df-4d96-a807-5b598df062c0"},{"text":"\n  So, it has a fan, but, it's louder than my gaming PC on full blast.

Not the ENORMOUS yardstick sized one, but the one that's the size of a submarine sammich/Hero/Hoagie. This expansion adds more black cards and more white cards for more funny and disturbing jokes than you could get with the box I bought. Since her pack is smaller I'm going to ask her to mark her cards so if we play together, we don't have to worry about who owns which cards when it's time to clean up and go home. Every time I talked about buying CAH, my boyfriend was motivated to point out that you can download the card designs online and print them out from home. Yeah, but no one wants to play CAH with pieces of paper. We want them on card stock and then you're stuck cutting cards out with scissors, which stinks. Not only does it hurt your hand but none of them are going to be exact, which makes them harder to shuffle and you can tell which card is which by the way it was cut out by hand.

First of all it does exactly what it says it will do.  It looks great and for what it says it will do, it beats paying almost $80 for a Pixel stand.  Here's where things get sticky and sent me down a rabbit hole about fast charging.  Most of you buying this will think like I did that when you put your phone on the charger it will say, \"Charging Rapidly\", well it won't.  It will say \"Charging Wirelessly\".When I first tried it, I used the supplied power block, so I figured that was the problem.  I then switched the stand to my normal Pixel block, same thing happened.  I put my Samsung Galaxy S7 on there, it says \"Fast Charging\", so now I'm confused.  Put the phone directly to the Google power block, it says, \"Charging Rapidly\".  To save you all the research hassle here's what you need to know because the topic itself is complicated and a bit confusing.  I used an app to measure the amount of watts the stand was producing.  It consistently read 9.9 watts, with or without the phone case on.  This wattage number falls in the  wattage range \"technically\" considered to be \"Fast Charging\", which is why the S7 stated that.  There are a couple of other charging rates, but that's another discussion.  In order to for you to see the \"Charging Rapidly\" like your power brick the stand needs to support Extended Power Profile (EPP) and it doesn't.  While it still works fine and technically does fast charge, it's not the same as the power brick.  All that being said, I dont know what you would have to do to make this thing output the full 15 Watts as the Pixel 4/XL would support wattage.  The Google power brick is 18W but the stand would only say 9.9W.  This is similar to other people online when discussing the whole fast charging issue and this particular stand.  I would love for Yootech to explain how to get the full 15W out of the stand which should make the phone say \"Charging Rapidly\" like you're used to seeing.  I think the stand is great, just be completely informed of your expectations.\n","id":"276b400e-8662-4022-93af-aab99aa61452"},{"text":"\n  Great charger!!

This is especially critical during the day.I have bought a couple other chargers that worked \"fine\" but didn't last. I came upon the Yootech Brandon amazon and gave them a try a while back. I purchased one for my garage and one for my house which worked great. As a matter of fact I think they worked a little too good because then I wanted one for my office at work. That turned into wanting to at my office for work. That gave me the ability to charge both my iPhone and my Android phone at the same time. I use my android as a radio so is its playing but is always charged at 100 percent se se its always docked.my iPhone I only leave on for a while about mid day to top of the battery.

The new one seems to have a fan inside that you can hear running if you put your ear extremely close to the unit maybe a couple inches of way. I'm thinking it must cool the charger from within which is always a good thing with electronics. The two things I like best about this charger. One I can charge my iPhone and Android with the same device and the second best part is you can grab your phone when you're in a rush without worry of unplugging the cord which is great when your in a hurry to go to a meeting.

I've always been one to spend more money on something with higher quality or going with a known name brand. However, after watching youtube review of this product, and at this price point, I figured why not. Plus the base acts as a wireless charger! I was looking into a wireleless charger for my desk as well, and after reading lots of reviews on diff products saying can't charge with case, I got worried this RGB stand would have same issue as I have an Otterbox case on my Iphone 11 Pro, so its pretty thick. WELL GUESS WHAT - IT CHARGED WITH MY CASE ON. I've seen ppl spend way more moeny on a wireless charger and cannot charge it with their case. Plus the stand is very nice and sturdy and holds my Arctic Series 7 headphones very well. Honestly this product is soooooooooo great and such a good value. No need to spend more money on a RAZR or some other name brand. The lighting is perfect, not too bright , not too dim. It's literally plug n play. Also this can be plugged into a wall outlet since it doesn't need to actually send data to PC, so if you're worried about having enough USBs no need to worry!

You can have all the colors, or select a color specific(up to 5 I think). I have 2 headsets that are identical, but work on 2 different consoles. So this saves me the headache of trying to figure out which headset is for what. Stand comes with a USB cord, and can be plugged into a brick or surge protector with USB ports. The price and functionality of this stand was perfect for my needs. My camera kept wanting to make the lights look insanely bright, so I adjusted the settings on my camera to as close to the actual brightness as I could get it.

I just started DoorDash/Uber eats and needed some type of mount so I could see my phone. I opted with the clamp style vs the magnetic as I read some reviews that if you have a heavier phone (I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max) that sometimes your phone can flip upside down or completely fall off and I do not want to risk the phone either falling in the middle of a drove or fall and crack the screen. So I got this clamp map and it works 100% of the time. Every time you put the phone up to the clamp it will auto open and you just set the phone in the clamp and it auto closes and I will tell you it holds the phone tight, it’s not going anywhere. If for any reason you loose power then you can easily pry the clamp open to get your device. The air vent mount holds onto the vent fairly tightly so I’m not worried about my phone going anywhere. Overall I am very happy with this car mount and highly recommend it. PS: I saw someone posted this can’t keep the phone charged while the screen is on, while using DoorDash/Uber eats and Waze with the screen on full brightness it does charge the phone, slower than normal since your using a lot of power but it will charge the phone and keep it charged.\n","id":"4838a752-2cde-49c6-a2e6-2e2ade975edc"},{"text":"\n  First off love this company really great customer service.

The bouncing and phone falling out does NOT happen with my Galaxy S8+. Using the Flexible Arm that is. The arm is very stiff and holds the position you set it for. The plug into the cigarette charging outlet also holds very tight. There is near no movement at all.I also read that the charging is not fast especially using apps like waze and music where there screen is on all the time. Also NOT true at least in my case. I put the phone in the charger at 70%, turned on waze and Pandora to Bluetooth to my car radio for a two hour long commute and within 15 minutes using the apps, the phone was at 100% fully charged and stayed that way all the way home. In my opinion, for the people who complained of the inadequate charging, perhaps the issues are your phones.The Sensor that detects the phone and quietly opens the jaws and then closes them could not have been designed any better.My ONLY complaint though a very minor one. The short cord used to plug into the plate and the charger is white. Everything else in the car and the flexible arm is black. The cord sticks out to the eye and can been easily seen from outside calling attention to it. I just need to find a black one. The other supplied cord is black but too long for the flexible arm.Overall, thank you for a very well thought out and well engineered product. It is also made well and not cheap at all.

So far, this one has lasted ok and despite the motorized arms that hold the phone feeling a little fragile, it's still working fine months later. Plus, this one has a charging pad, so I don't have to run a second cable to the phone.But speaking of that charging function, that is my first disappointment with this unit. The base which plugs into the lighter has two USB ports. You will need one of these and a cable run to the charging pad. While the cable is included, it's a little odd that they couldn't have run power up to the pad through the arm as they did for the side arms to open and close. It's not a deal breaker, but it makes things a little messier than they need be.The second issue I have is this unit isn't the lightest, especially when it had a phone on the charger. It's putting a lot of weight strain on my lighter that it wasn't designed to handle. I can see the lighter socket drooping a little since I've had this. It would be nice if this came with maybe a kickstand of sorts to help prop it up and take some weight off that port.Aside from putting too much weight on the lighter port, I do have to adjust it in the lighter port every once in a while because the weight will wiggle it out enough that it doesn't get power. It's not a huge deal, but it's a bit annoying. It's also worth mentioning that the plug does fit the port rather tight and this could cause an issue for anyone who needed to remove this charger often.The other issue I have with this is that due to where the lighter is in my car, the phone mounts rather low. It's about eye to eye with the shifter. Not only does that make it slightly in the way when putting my car in gear, but it also means I have to take my eye off the road and look down to see the GPS. This could be a big issue, and I would recommend anyone use a lot of caution when using GPS with this.Other than that, it's been good so far. It hasn't dropped my phone or slipped yet. It gives a consistent charge and I can plug in another USB cable for any passengers. Honestly, every mount I've bought has been flawed, but this one is the least flawed I've used.\n","id":"9c5d2f63-de30-4652-9344-6f9fb43e433f"},{"text":"\n  I've tried many different phone mounts and magnetic is by far the best type out there. I had been looking for a wireless magnetic mount for months so I could finally take advantage of Qi charging. It's tricky, because the standard metal plates can't be used. I've seen ring magnets that surround the coils, and this unit uses plates above and below. Read lots of reviews of mounts and decided to pull the trigger on this one. It works great and I love not needing to plug in my phone anymore.The main sticking point is that the metal plates need to go on the outside of the case. It's not ideal, but ultimately I decided that I valued the convenience of wireless charging more than a perfectly smooth back to the case, and I still feel this way after using it for a month. Placing the plates inside a case makes it not strong enough to hold.Unexpected perk of wireless charging? No longer needing to account for a charging cable under my phone and it's added length, more positions in my car became usable. I have this mounted to my dashboard, which was previously impossible.I do not have issues with charge rate while using navigation. I suspect those that do have not placed their phone in the right position (and those examples actually come from other mounts).\n","id":"9d314859-8e7f-424c-b3a7-94fdf8974b57"},{"text":"\n  I bought this for my F150 seeing claims that the magnets you have to stick on the back of your phone will not negatively effect the phone, the charger, or anything else.  With the magnets attached, my phone stayed in place well when attached to the charger and it initially charged perfectly.  I have a Galaxy S8.  After the honeymoon period of a week or so, things started not working so well.  Sometimes I couldn't get the phone to charge when attached to the MagicMount charger.  Sometimes the phone would not charge  on my Samsung wireless charging pad on my nightstand.  I'd wake up in the morning and my phone wouldn't be charged.  Sometimes the wireless charging function on my phone wouldn't work at all no matter what wireless charger I used.I figured out that the magnets attached to the back of the phone were causing problems with my charging pad and the phone itself.  Sometimes, if I unplugged/replugged the Samsung wireless charging pad, wireless charging would work for a while.  Other times if I would reboot the phone, wireless charging would resume working again (for a while).In the end, I removed the magnets and I haven't had a problem with wireless charging since.  Problem is, this new Scosche mount and charger I bought are useless in the car without the magnets to hold it in place.  I can't recommend this product at all.

You do have to be careful to place it very close to the center of the phone. I used the plates that mount on the outside of my Galaxy S8 case. There are two small plates that mount just below the camera opening and near the bottom.  I'm not crazy about having these things on the outside of my phone/case but, I didn't want to stick something to my beautiful S8 because it would hurt resale value.

But does it? I'll try to answer this question in my review.It's spec says take 9v 3a, using a USB-C with QC3.0 charger my own tests with iPhone Xs and Note 10 is around 18w combined. very close to theoretical fast wireless charging specs: Note 10 - 10w, iPhone 7.5w. because it just measuring input power, actually energy converted to phones is less. When charging standalone, my reading on iPhone is 10w and Note 10 is also constantly 10w, it's very normal that power measurement tool reading some fluctuation because of battery SoC, coil alignment or charging algorithm. so I can only say is just meet my minimal requirement. But this is not the end of story, when I changed to Apple 60w USB-C charger instead of QC 3.0 compatible charger, the power input down to 5v x 2.4a, it's a lot slower than QC 3.0, which also means this charger won't accept USB-PD protocol as power input.It can't support apple watch, since it's using apple's proprietary protocol obviously, this reduce overall effectiveness of having such large wireless charging pad only support phones. I can only hope lateral generation of apple watch could stick to Qi standard like Airpods did.(It does charge airpods of course)I also attached some thermal image with it, after an hour charging with Note 10. temp is within 110F, about average compare to peers not write home about. But there is another issue when I test it with iPhone on the right: when there was a calling cause vibration, I saw iPhone on the right side slowly slide to the table! I carefully check the materials on the charger, it's not evenly spread across the surface, it's hump in the center but inclined to the side.So the answer might be No for heavy Apple user want a Airpower replacement:1. It can't charging your apple watch and iPhone side by side.2. the charging mat might have some issue with a vibrating uncased iPhone.3. It won't take highest input power from Apple USB-PD compatible charger.I'd say it's best value resides in compact package, able to charging two phones or phones with Airpods, and the price is within a good margin of buying separate two Qi charger.\n","id":"bb9705d8-0d23-4aa3-8e43-68a70929ce74"},{"text":"\n  So my routine after coming home includes placing my phone on the wireless charger.

So in the event I need to fast charge my phone from the cable, since it is a bit faster, I still can!\n","id":"00a069b2-4949-463a-ad62-3b6bfe3c2c30"},{"text":"\n  This is the best wireless charger that I've tried in many time.The first what I liked is the look. It's really nice and classy, with a sober looks and soft touch. However, the materials are good quality.Second, and maybe most important. You can charge two or even three (not recomended) devices at the same time. In my case, because the absurd position of coils on my phone (Razer Phone 2) I haven't used any charger. This, with 5 coils allows charge my phone in a confortable position. Also, I can charge my headphones too (Altec Lansing True Evo).It's really convenient and of course, easy to get use to it.  Another positive thing, is the heat disipation; as soon the phone was full, the energy cuts off and lost temperature really fast.It has just one bad/good thing. The speed of charge is about 1000mAh, that is the usual standard on this kind of chargers.  And I said \"bad/good\" because is not useful to a hurry, but is healthy for your battery, so, despite that, this charger is highly recomended.\n","id":"ac658f31-2a4a-40e4-ba4d-78d6ebab9b7c"},{"text":"\n  I got this charger to test out & see if I would like it. I have always wanted one but never really made the effort to purchase it since i am afraid it will be bad or die on me right away. I had a Samsung one that didn't even work for my Samsung s8+. However i am very glad this product works like magic. It doesn't come with an adapter but im sure you can find one around the house you just plug it in and go. I do have to take off my phone case since it is very thick but i don't mind it at all. Since most of the cords i have are short i can never really look at my phone in different positions. But at least with this i can just grab my phone whenever and put it back on the charging base and it'll charge.

What I really like about this one compared to the other one is that it is very quiet when it opens and closes. The sensor to open and close is on top so it is less likely for me to accidentally release it when I don't want it to. It's a small thing but I also like that if you miss placing the phone on the holder, it will shut partly then it knows to open back up instead of closing all the way. My other rone would close all the way and it took forever to recycle back and open.My 1st plan was to set this on the cup holder but it fit my old suction cup holder perfectly. The lights and colors are a nice touch. I have a side gig delivering packages, so this works perfectly when I have to hop in and out of the car 20 to 30 times in a day.\n","id":"b2e1614f-45fd-42ac-9591-482c68c02805"},{"text":"\n  Subpar results for ok expectations. Bought this one because it was a little cheaper than the next available one, like most people on here would shop.Doesn’t come with charger but it states in the description that it doesn’t. I only stated this for the person who isn’t reading the description.Very versatile in cup holder size, can go from Red Bull sized to large Gatorade with a few twists. Sturdy enough to keep your phone from vibrating during travel. Automated operations are hit or miss and too slow for my liking but this is probably a safety feature built in to keep from crushing your fingers when dropping the phone in the cradle. Can only really operate with it plugged in so if your port in the car turns off before you uncradle your phone, you need to force it out.Charging was the only real negative that I disliked about this. Everything else while a slight annoyance I could live with. The thing doesn’t function at all with a 2.1 amp charger which you would think would at least slow charge a phone but it doesn’t. It just blinks and barely functions. With a QC 3.0 charger it functions and while granted I’m using an iPhone 11 Pro that doesn’t support TurboCharging it doesn’t charge nearly as fast as on my other Qi devices. I used a Galaxy phone on it and it did charge with turbo charging again not as quick as my other devices and got both phones hot.Would I buy it again? ProbablyWould this be my first choice? Probably not, but it would be in the top 3-5 choices available on Amazon.What would I recommend to seller? Offering a QC 3.0 charger that worked with their device that offered the best performance in charging. Even if as an additional add on in checkout so that they could keep cost lower for those that want to use their own.\n","id":"c0b649eb-5113-45df-ac4b-fe97a693bc6c"},{"text":"\n  I drive 18 wheelers n couldn't find a mount that mounts to dash and found this cupholder/ vent mount.

The fact I can actually sent this in the cup holder and it comes with an adjustable like bar to angle to my comfort is great.

It charges my Google Pixel 4 well.  It's actually pretty fast, too.  I was impressed how quickly it charged one day while I was playing music and using Google Maps at the same time.  The colors are neat, but then can't really be seen once the phone is in the cradle.  Easy to put the phone in and take out, and holds the phone well.  I just wish there was a way to use the cradle without it being plugged in.  If my phone is charged, or has ample battery life, I don't have a need to keep charging it, but I would like to use the cradle still to hold the phone.As for the cup holder side of things,  I have a 2007 Honda Civic.  It fits well inside the cup holder, and is pretty sturdy.  The charger moves very slightly inside that it's not an issue at all.  I did have to make sure I spread the wings out to get a better hold, but it's great.I don't know if it would be better or worse, but I am thinking an inch or so longer on the arm to make for easier viewing when driving.  I do have to look rather far down to see my phone screen if I am confused on directions, like when you get into a city area.Overall, a great product, and I did have to contact them at one point for an easy fix.

As we trained our German Shepherd using the wireless containment system, we followed the directions precisely. At first, things worked well. Our dog knew her boundary. The system worked when it needed to, and our dog knew to run back toward the house when she had gone too far.But as time went on, the system became more and more inconsistent. All dogs need consistency, especially German Shepherds. At times, the system would start to shock her while she was safely inside her zone. At other times, the system wouldn't shock her when she went beyond her boundary. We tried troubleshooting by unplugging the transmitter and plugging it back in again. We changed batteries in her collar. We tried adjusting the circumference of her circle. Sometimes it would work, but inevitably, it would go back to its inconsistent ways.Today was the last straw. I was outside with our German Shepherd when someone walked by with his dog. The other dog was safely outside of our dog's radius, but because the system has been so inconsistent recently, my dog ran to the other dog. Thankfully, I was able to call her back right away, but I could tell the other dog owner was a little frightened by the experience. And I don't blame him! My dog should have stayed in her yard. But the system failed to work. Then, as I was bringing my dog into the house, safely within the containment system, the collar started zapping her without warning. She completely freaked out, and she is now terrified to go into our kitchen and out the back door.Needless to say, I'm done with this product. I cannot recommend it as it currently works to anyone who loves their pet. It is too inconsistent and can cause more damage than good. I wish it worked. I wish it did what it promised. I wish I got what I paid for. But instead, I have a nervous dog who gets shocked inside the house, safely inside her radius and doesn't get shocked when she goes outside of the safe zone.\n","id":"03eae9ea-de44-4010-9aca-e034ad01ef02"},{"text":"\n  I took quite a bit of time setting this up, following all the directions to the letter.  Our property is perfectly flat and there are no large metal objects interfering with the transmission.  Nearest the road, where we are most concerned, there is no signal at all in certain areas, so we do not relax when we let her out, constantly watching.  This defeats the purpose.  During the training sessions, I put it on the lowest setting as instructed and she yelped and jumped high in the air when she reached the perimeter.  I tested it on myself and it was pretty brutal.  I wish I could send this back, but first of all, they packaged it so you have to destroy (shred)  the box to open  it.  More importantly since we were very motivated to make this work,  we hung in there trying different locations and settings and alas, it is past the return date.

As well as the fact that the stand itself is kind of heavy, then you add a phone to it which makes it heavier. Therefore it droops the vent slit & makes it hard to keep the charger in the position you have chosen.  The charger dock seems really sturdy, but when you are driving your phone is constantly bouncing up-and-down due to the heaviness and event slip not being able to compensate with it.Over all the price tag is a little up there for a product that I would not put at such a hefty price tag.

I have a case on my phone (iBlason Ares), and it charges fine.There’s a rubber grip on the bottom of the phone dock to prevent it from slipping, and it worked perfectly as I watched videos both horizontally and vertically.The iPhone 11 does block the watch if it’s horizontal and both are charging simultaneously, but honestly that shouldn’t be an issue, and I use my phone for alarms, notifications, and videos if I’m not wearing the watch.I highly recommend this product, if you don’t need one with an Airpods charger (I don’t use airpods so this was perfect).\n","id":"94a6f54e-d528-4603-b88f-c8a367262973"},{"text":"\n  I really like the size of this charger and the convenience of having 2 chargers in one! I dug for days looking for the perfect charger; it had to have the right size, nightstand mode for my iWatch, my phone had to stand up (not lay sideways, although it can on this charger), and ONE PLUG IN! I saw several chargers that charged both my watch and phone BUT had two plugs... what’s the point? Very happy with my purchase and the price was very reasonable for the quality of the charger stand!\n","id":"9a8f3040-76ff-423f-966c-786a4d9d5166"},{"text":"\n  Ok I wanna start this by saying a lot of people who review this product clearly didn’t read the description. I knew that this was only a fast wireless charger that happened to be crafted to be a stand and also power another usb device in this case an I watch. I also knew to get a Quick Charging cube version 3.0 as suggested and have had not problems charging both my phone and watch at the same time. It’s smart to rely on charging for the Apple Watch to come from an Apple Watch charging cable and provide a little space at the bottom to store the extra length of the cable.Another thing I thought was impressive was the quality of the built in wireless charger. While the unit is made of plastic (which I don’t mind personally. Especially at this price) it is a sleek design and works well. I use a thick wallet case on my iPhone XS Max and I can still use the charger with 3 cards and one house key in the back. I was shook when I popped it on the charger and it actually fast charged. I thought for sure I would have to either take the case off or the cards out but no need. It has made my life awesome.Also I love the angel for the phone to stand up. It’s up enough to FaceTime without it looking to weird but slanted enough with the stoppers at the bottom to help keep the phone in place.\n","id":"82b0f047-5086-4000-ace0-862289e3e4f4"},{"text":"\n  This is very convenient for spectacles, keys and jewels.\n","id":"e5a6745d-ceba-428f-b4f7-1111957dbdfa"},{"text":"\n  Very Good~\n","id":"25b553d3-cc07-4f35-953a-fa1648fe278f"},{"text":"\n  These are awesome! Inside the box, there's a power adapter (that plugs into the wall), the charging dock itself, and a charging chord with USB-C connections on each end (which plugs into the power adapter and the dock). I am not sure if this chord transfers data, but it might be a good idea to test that out in case you ever need to use it for something else, like phone-to-tablet/PC file sharing. I haven't tried it yet.It charges fast...in the 5 minutes it took me to put this review together, it charged my phone from 77% to 87%, so it's quick. I will probably buy another one for my desk at work!Also, since the headphone jack is on the bottom of my Galaxy S10+, I had to turn the phone sideways while it was sitting in the charging dock if I wanted to plug in my earbuds while charging...You can sit it vertically or sideways and it will still charge just fine. It's amazing and it looks great!**UPDATE**Okay, after living with these things for a couple of weeks now, I changed the review from 5 stars to 4 stars. The charger is noisy...like, a supersonic, high-pitched noise starts happening when the phone is charging. At night, when all is quiet, it's very audible. I can even hear it when I'm watching movies in bed. I have two of these chargers, and they both do it. Also, the phone gets pretty hot when it is charging. Heat = death to electronics, which makes me nervous.

However, playing my watch on pad is a constant struggle to find a sweet spot for the charge to be steady and consistent. Typically it turns on and off. I tried taking off the cover for my watch that did not help. I took off the straps to that did not help at all . I don't know what else to do except return it . I also had the older version of the Samsung dual charging station but I had the same issue. Samsung needs to improve how they charge their watches . Most of us use covers on our watches to protect our investment. The covers should not affect the charge. Nonetheless, I tried shifting the watch, moving around on the charging spot, leaving it there for a while, and nothing worked (with and without the watch cover). at first I thought it was defective with my older version of the Samsung dual. Then I returned that one and I got the Samsung duo 2.0 and the same problem existed. the concept is nice but the bottom line is the Samsung duo is inefficient for a good strong and steady charge on the Galaxy smartwatches.

Biggest issue seemed to be the relatively small spot to place your phone.  Many people would wake up the next day and their phone was not charged.  The ZENS reviews generally agreed that ZENS had a larger \"sweet spot\" and helped avoid that problem.  I emphasize \"larger\" as opposed to a \"BIG\" sweet spot.  You stlll need to be fairly precise when placing your phone on the charger.Phone did not charge the first two nights - even though I was very careful to be sure it started charging before I walked away.Decided to take the cover off the phone and try again.  It was still difficult to get it set up correctly.  Then realized I had a magnet on the back of the phone to use in my magnetic mount in my car.  DUH!  Took the magnet off and everything worked fine.I went to the ZENS web site to confirm the magnet / cover issue.  FAQ was difficult to find.  Spent too much time looking for it.  I expected it to be in a link at the top of the page.  NOPE.  It was at the bottom of the page in the site map (?) section.  Not a great place to put something as important as this.  BUT... FAQ confirmed you CAN charge your phone with MOST lightweight covers and NO a metal case might need to be removed (presumably that would include magnets).Why 4 stars?  Watch charger works great - although the watch band dangles above one of the charging points and gets in the way.  The phone charger seems to be working now.  Very happy about this.  But, you still need to be sure you place the phone in the correct spot and it is charging before you walk away.My suggestion to ZENS (and other manufacturers) - spend the extra dollar to make the charging spot larger.\n","id":"e4f5d75f-6c64-48f3-8995-6236d65c9e2e"},{"text":"\n  Not sure about this.

The base charges through it all. There is a sweet spot with that much crap interfering, but it does it. Having all that in the way is on me, not the charger. I’m just pleased it still works and charges to full through all that.In addition, the charging base has two white LEDs that illuminate when it has proper charge contact, so it’s easy to check for a good connection right before I go to sleep. Don’t even have to sit upBoth lights are not too bright to be bothersome. Excellent electrical engineering.Also, my work iPhone XR, which has the lighter of the Otterbox cases, charges great on it as well. No struggle to find a ‘sweet spot’ there!

The UAG case is pretty burley so slimmer cases should have no issues at all if the UAG works.The charger is very solid feeling and you can tell it is made of a lot of metal. The Apple Watch arms does not budge of bend.PROs:- built solid!- does not get hot even charging three devices- no fans that would create extra noise- charges fast!!The only CONS I can think of:-  A proprietary charging cable instead of a usb cable. So if it breaks or you need a longer cable you’ll need to find he right relplacemet or use an extension cord.- the phone that you’d place under the watch is blocked if you are charging a watch.

My Gear S3 Frontier watch would overheat using the flat charger. My watch would throw an error in red to use the original charger - odd.

The watch charger half should have been on a cantilevered arm.  HOWEVER, I just increased my rating of this device because the watch charging station is a lot more versatile than I thought.

Never heard of this brand and wasn't sure if this charger would be good or not but for less than half the price of the official charger, I said why not. Well I can tell you this charger works great, charges fast, and you should definitely get it. Also, it is pretty small and flat while still being very sturdy. As a plus you can also charge other things like your phone if they use USB-C.That said, the only thing that some people may not like is that a really small USB-C charging dongle stays connected at the top of the PS5 controller. This is connected so that when you want to charge the controller again, you simply plug the controller into the charging station. Of course you can always remove the dongle if it bothers you that much but you will have to connect it again if you want to charge your controller.5 stars!

Seems counter-intuitive to have to do that.Speaker is nice quality.  Operation is a little unusual.  Plan on downloading yet another proprietary app to set things like alarms.  You also have to be connected to via Bluetooth Phone/Media audio to use it so plan on your calls being hijacked if you're with your phone in the next room.Wireless charging, part of what lured me in, works but my phone is so hot in the morning I fear it might be doing some damage.  I have a case but I also have wireless chargers in my car and at work and the phone never gets hot to the touch.\n","id":"cd0fc113-78e8-46f3-b02a-ee0d56e7a7d3"},{"text":"\n  [UPDATE 7 Nov 2019]After 4 months with this, still call it 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.  Brightness got a little better after the 0.6 firmware update, but still too bright.  I still find myself wishing Anker had opted for red or green LEDs like older plain alarm clocks tend to use.  I know I could turn off the display, but I like being able to look at it in the middle of the night when I pop awake sometimes.Despite that, I do manage to sleep just fine.  I just think it's a minor design/engineering fail.I also sometimes have to deal with annoyance of the Wakey deciding it needs to flash \"No Alarm\" or something like that for no reason I can figure out.Looking forward to further firmware updates.[Original review follows]This is really a 3.5 star rating rounded up because we can't do half stars here, I don't think.I've only had it for one night so far, and it works as advertised, which is a major plus.  This is not my first Qi-equipped alarm clock - if this one has better longevity that my previous ones, I'll be very happy.  It's an Anker product, so I have hope.  Especially for a product costing $100.I agree with other reviewers about the brightness of the blue wireless charging led and the clock numbers.  It would be nice to be able to change the blue to red (figure that's not possible) or disable it completely (future firmware RFE).  It would also be nice to make the clock numbers dim more at night.  It didn't really bother me last night, but compared to my wife's \"regular\" alarm clock with green numbers, it's *really* bright.  I don't know why companies think white is a good color for alarm clock numbers.  All of that is one star off.I also would deduct a half star for having to set the time via a bluetooth-connected app on my phone/tablet.  That's just silly IMO.I do very much like that I can plug my other Qi charging stand for my phone into the Wakey (I charge my tablet on the Wakey) and cut down on the things plugged into the power strip.

My jaws were literally dropped after I paired this headphone up with my phone, and the first song \"Hotel California\" (Eagles, Live) played out the earpiece. I closed my eyes and this headphone brought me to the live concert hall. I then continued to play thru a bunch of audiophile soundtracks to give this pair of headphone a worthy test-drive.The acoustic performance of this headphone is truly phenomenal (concluded after a few hours of listening now). The bass is tight and accurate, probably benefited from the 40mm driver element inside this headphone, the volume of air it can move is not anything that an earbud can compare. The midrange is smooth, yet texturized, layered with fantastic details. The treble is clean, clear and silky. It is really a pleasant surprise to hear such studio quality of music reproduction in this headphone from Marshall. The microphone on this headphone is also very good, I asked about my voice input in a few teleconferences, and the responses are positive.This headphone is indeed comfortable. The ear cushions are very soft, and the size adjustment is massive (seldom do I find a headphone that will fit my 8years old as well as it fits me). I was a bit skeptical first, as this is an \"on the ear\" headphone, I was worry that it would not be too comfortable; but now I have to say that, to a certain extend, this one is more comfortable than the \"over the ear\" type as it enables more air-flow, it is \"cooler\" and less \"hot/warm\".I also love the single \"multi-directional control knob\", on/off, pairing, volume, track control etc. all intuitively managed by this single knob, brilliant design!Last, but not least, charging this headphone is as simple as putting it on a Qi wireless charging pad. Or hook up an USB-C cable. One full charge is supposed to last 80hours.2 minor things that I wished Marshall included with this amazing headphones:- a carrying case- a wireless charging padThen this would have been a PERFECT product.Please note that there is no noise cancellation capability on this headphone.

I was shocked initially at how small the padded ear areas were, compared to other higher end over-the-head earphones I own.Does it live up to the hype? Sort of. I love my Shure and Sony BT over-the-ear headphones, so I definitely was curious about checking out other ones by another infamous brand like Marshall. While the quality of the sound is nice, I think it definitely depends on what kinds of music you are planning to listen to while using them. I listen to a lot of EDM and things with a lot of thumping bass and treble beats - and while I would call these \"good\" in those areas, they're not mind-blowing. There's no way to adjust the equalizer, and no app to help customize it. At full volume, it starts to get a little distorted, which was a little disappointing, too.While I usually prefer larger ear muffs on earphones, I was surprised at how comfortable these were, given their smaller sized pads. They are surprisingly comfy, even when worn for hours. They're a little less bulky and lighter weight than my Shures, and the comfort level for me is why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 3. I also LOVE the fact that the battery life is very long-lived, and you can charge these wirelessly. That said, you are only given a charge cord to charge them with, and there's no included protective case to store them in - not even a storage pouch, like most other earphones include.Overall, they're decent headphones, but I wish there were more features to them.

I used it almost every night since its original purchase on 10/9/19, but 3 days after getting my iPhone 12 Pro it has died.

I've accidentally not charged my phone a couple of times already though.- The indicator lights are hard to see — I like that they are subtle (particularly good for a nightstand) but they're hidden underneath almost. It would be great if they maybe blinked brightly for a few seconds when the device is initially placed on charge and then dimmed to the current setting.Other:- The AirPods fit in a little \"bowl\" making it easier to set them down right, BUT it doesn't fit the AirPods Pro, so be wary if you own those!\n","id":"57192f6d-bd8f-482a-9789-6d25ecff41d3"},{"text":"\n  So I waited a bit for this review. When I see negative reviews for a product I become very skeptical. There are enough negative reviews here to warrant hesitation in purchasing such a pricey product. I held off and did some research. Not just on the product, but the brand and wireless charging in general. A few things stood out. Most people don’t understand how wireless charging works. They assume you can just plop your phone down however which way on the mat and it should charge without fail. No ma’am / sir. In a nutshell you have two small discs, one in your phone and one in the charger. The discs must be close enough together in order for wireless charging to work. If your phone/watch/air pods are too far they won’t charge. Simple. Right? Apparently not for many. Almost every charger on here and other stores have piss poor ratings. And the ones that actually reviewed the products show their lack of understanding on how the product is supposed to work. You wouldn’t buy a bicycle and expect it to take you places on its own would you? Same goes for this. Like any charger it needs to be plugged into a wall socket for power. I only say that because there was a review that didn’t realized it needs to be plugged in. (face palm). And they gave it one star for it!With that out of the way this particular charger was everything I was looking for. It can charge a phone, Apple Watch, AirPods and yes AirPods Pro. Keep in mind it will charge an “Apple” watch, not other brands. And AirPods with the wireless charging case. Seems redundant but it has to be said. This charge follows the Qi (chi?) standard, so any phone that uses the same standard will charge on it. Different phones have the aforementioned “disc” in different spots, so how the phone needs to be placed on the charger will vary. Also understand wireless charging generates heat. Your phone will become warm. The more power is transferred the hotter it gets. It’s one of the reasons iPhones are capped to 7.5 watts on wireless charging. Apple is being cautious here, and rightfully so. Heat does things to batteries (*cough*samsung). Also electronics can and do fail. So if you’ve legitimately received a defective unit. Just return it and stop whining.\n","id":"2f64077e-c9f9-4417-b6d5-ff91662c4887"},{"text":"\n  After only a couple months, it stopped charging .... now it’s intermittent at best.  Very disappointed.

I was very hopeful about this product as I had seen it at the Central Park Apple Store.I should have returned this product when I had the chance. It is supposed to be a convenient, attractive  device for charging Apple Watch, Apple AirPods, and Apple iPhone.Only the watch device is as simple to use as advertised. The AirPods have to be placed exactly upon their designed spot, but they’re not the problem. Your iPhone has to be placed in an exact way to charge wirelessly, and after five months of use, I sometimes still cannot place my phone perfectly enough to charge. It’s infuriating to wake up and find that my phone has not charged.Don’t buy this garbage. Wait until a dependable all-in-one product hits the market.

Other mounts have a release button to easily open the bracket, fit your phone in, and then manually slide closed. This product has a tension spring that must be pried open in order to fit a phone inside. It is VERY hard to do this with one hand, and is not easy even with 2 hands, since you must hole the phone while mounting it. Lets not get carried away, its a phone bracket, so were not talking extreme strength required, but its is difficult to do whereas other mounts I have used are very easy with a single hand.More importantly, after using the charger for about 30 minutes the first time, my phone (iphone 8) froze. It was unresponsive to any buttons including the manual shut forced restart. After a few minutes, I plugged the phone into a different (not wireless) charger and the phone unfroze. It happened one more time, and then the charger stopped charging completely. I called Belkin, who I thought of as a reputable company. I expected them to either tell me it was a known issue or to (at least act) shocked and apologize (at the very least, tell the customer what they want to hear and politely say you cant do anything.)

There are a few things to like about this mousepad and I will certainly admit that.  It's rather large, about double the size of a standard mousepad.  I like that as you don't have to consistently adjust the pad to make sure your mouse stays on it.  The lighting is cool and I like how you can adjust the light setting by simply tapping the little fingerprint marking.The negatives here are in the product not living up to the wireless charging side of things.  It does wirelessly charge but at a snail's pace.  It also is very fussy.  You have to set your phone in just the right spot and also if your phone has a case on it, it will need to be a very thin one to work. The other slight negative is the lights are on the dim side.  Very hard to see the lighting when you're in an office setting.  If you are in a room with dim lighting with a gaming rig then the lighting should stand out more.  Also, when you are able to get the wireless charging to work, the lighting shuts off.  I am guessing because it's pulling the power to charge the phone instead of towards the lights.Overall it's a cool concept but needs some work.

This dock was exactly what I needed to use at home, but I’ve also noted that it is very portable. I plan on taking it with me when I travel for work again in the near future. It also has standard and micro sd card slots to download data (which I use on my security cameras at home). It has power delivery over usb-c for maximum charge time on phones that support it and (3) usb 2.0 ports (mouse/keyboard) and (3) usb 3.0 ports (data transfer from hard drives, thumb drives etc.). My only gripe is 4K 30hz over the hdmi, but for a majority of people, this dock supports 1080p 60hz monitors which this dock supports.\n","id":"e33033ab-e7ad-4eb1-80f2-dd1893796b86"},{"text":"\n  Very thick pad, nice.

My only problem with this purchase: there is no belt clip cover for this as of SEPT 2020. I don't like running screen protectors especially for the note 20 ultra due to the fingerprint sensor not working. If I put this huge thing in my pocket, doesn't fit. I keep a sports bag and store it there. Be careful not to put keys or anything in the same pocket as to not scratch the phone screen. I need a belt clip cover asap. However, As far as performance, there are no complaints! I run this bad boy with an extra external 25000 mAh battery in my bag, as a backup combined with this zero lemon battery case  Using my phone on highest performance I can sit around browsing the internet as needed or watching YouTube. My power NEVER goes down under 100%. With just this case alone, You could probably charge your note 20 ultra 4x over on regular settings. Overkill? Possibly but very cool! side note -- I do keep a smaller slim otterbox rip off brand purchased from eBay for 10 bucks and use that when going out, where keeping a giant brick in your pocket/bag is not feasible.\n","id":"e47b129e-7c1b-4b2c-99f3-4e8e8a0718c7"},{"text":"\n  This is the ULTIMATE battery case for the Samsung Note 20 Ultra.I am admittedly a heavy user of my phone.  I own a small business, I get alot of email.  I make and receive alot of calls, I regularly consult the internet, and I like to listen to music or watch video/TV on my phone during down time.If you are reading this, you probably have a Note 20 Ultra 5G, you probably had that same \"oh wow this new phone is SO NEAT!\" then, a little later, \"what the HECK happened to my battery charge?\" rollercoaster thought process that I had,  and you know that in order to use the big upgrades from the previous generation of Note (Note 10 Plus), you need a battery case or chargers everywhere you go.Yes, it has adaptive battery management and yes, you can turn off the 120mhz refresh, 5G, Google Assitant, Bixby voice activation, NFC, GPS, Bluetooth, adaptive display brightness, turn down the brightness, slow down the CPU, more aggressively manage memory, etc... and then you have a Note 10 Plus (which I traded and then paid for a Note 20 Ultra 5g) or less.The Note 20 Ultra 5g is a GREAT phone, but it needs more battery than Samsung gave it to utilize its marquee features in most use case scenarios.  In fact, if you get a full day out of a Note 20 5g's onboard battery, I'd hazard to guess that you should have gotten a cheaper phone.  And if you have a Note 20 Ultra 5G I don't need to tell you this, but I'll say 25W charging doesn't make up for the battery drain and brings back the days when you have to keep an eye on your battery percentage and schedule charges.  Battery anxiety should be a thing of the past, but it isn't.Enter Zerolemon.I have had Zerolemon cases for years and years, and they really have perfected their product with the 10,000mah battery case for the Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5g.  I had the same case for my Note 10 Plus, but this one has some not-so-obvious improvements.Since Samsung switched the sides of the volume and power/Bixby keys to the right of the phone, note that the volume up and down keys start at the camera indent in the back.  So, instead of relying on your sense of touch to find the volume and power keys on a monolithic side (used to be a problem for me with the Note 10 Plus), there is a big transition in the case to guide your fingers to the correct button.Speaking of the camera, the Note 20 Ultra 5g's protrudes quite a bit from the phone.  With this case on, it is fully protected and kept off of surface.  Similarly, there is a lip at the top and bottom of the case on front to protect the front screen of the phone from face-down contact.The case charges on a Qi charger.  It supports fast charging.  My USB-C headphones work and so does Samsung DEX (wired).  It does not affect my cellular reception, voice quality, sound quality (there is a grill over the bottom firing speaker--it seems to impart some extra bass), or access to the S pen.  The three phone side buttons are easy to find and press.This is a three-piece case similar to the Otterbox Defender setup, so the phone snaps into a hard ABS case that has a power adapter at the bottom and is then surrounded by a TPU-type case.  There is a button on the back that allows you to turn battery charing on and off, and activate the OTG function.  There are also LEDs sowing the charge level of the case.The case will stand on its sides, on a table, for viewing.  It has a texture on the outside that doesn't show fingerprints and isn't too slippery.  I haven't checked yet, but Zerolemon usually makes a belt carrier for their big cases.It is a substantial, sturdy, solid case because it has a BIG battery.  This is not for your pocket unless you wear overalls or cargo pants.  But the size and heft oddly make the phone easier to hold, for me (with large hands), and serves the double purpose of adding battery capacity and protection for a glass phone.  Curved screens look neat, but there are also constant unintentional screen touches--that won't happen with this case.  I find typing easier with a thicker phone/case.  Speakerphone and bluetooth seem to work the same as without the case.  The annoying wobble from the bare phone on a flat surface--due to the camera hump--is eliminated with the Zerolemon case.So, get the Zerolemon 10,000mah case, then turn EVERYTHING on, including full brightness, 5G, 120mhz refresh, video wallpaper, all voice recognition, 5G, hotspot, mobile data/wifi on always (in developer options), video enhancer, and everything else, and then stream video all day. Use the Note 20 Ultra 5G to its full potential.  I have not been able to kill this battery in anything close to a day with everything on and using my phone like a TV is a sports bar.  On the subject of NFC, I am able to use Samsung Pay with the case ON--your mileage may vary but I did so twice yesterday.Really, I can only think of one improvement that would be welcome--probably only by me--and that is some sort of flap cover for the front of the phone; maybe on with the magnet in it like the Samsung S-View case so the screen comes on when I open it and it shows the time and notifications on the side.  In fact, just make the outside look like a small leatherbound book and I would be happy.  Unfortunately, I think that is such a niche request and the Note 20 Ultra 5g is such a niche device, it may be a little selfish to even voice that wish.The warranty is unbeatable.Another winner from Zerolemon.  I LOVE it.\n","id":"cb8514fd-dd0a-4936-ba58-385ce79b0fec"},{"text":"\n  I've been using Zerolemon battery cases and battery packs for over a decade now.

However, I use a case with my iPhone 6 Plus and the product will not work with my iPhone without removing the case. I do a reasonable amount of product design, and I am baffled by the fact that whoever designed this product clearly did little or no actual testing of the product to verify their statement of \"Easily adjusts to fit your case\". As you can see by the photos, the base support for the Lightning connector is abnormally large, and the Lightning connector itself does not extend high enough to overcome the thickness of my case, which is only 1/10\" thick. As a result, the Lightning connector does not come into contact with the contacts on my iPhone and therefore does not work. So even though the height is adjustable, the overly large Lightning connector base will not fit into the reasonable opening of my case to allow the product to function properly.

Wireless charging for cell phones is here.  What kind of magic is this?Ever since getting the iPhone XR, I have wanted wireless charging in my phone mount for my Jeep.  I finally broke down and took a chance on this wireless charging phone mount.  After a couple days, I'm pretty impressed so far.  Let me break down what I like and dislike about this charger:Pros:*  Wireless charging is fast and works well*  Unit is well made and very attractive.  Would look nice in high end vehicles*  Motorized tension bars are pretty cool and hold the phone tightly*  Uses USB-C power cord which is a nice touch*  Package comes with several mounting accessories and standard ball type mounting*  Ball type mount allows you to use mounts from other companies if needed*  The suction cup mount is big and solid.  If you have a flat surface, this will work wellCons:*  In comparison to another CD mount that I have, this one is a little lighter duty and caused some minor bounce with a heavy phone (I use a different mount so not an issue)*  Motorized tension bars require power to be on to work.  I will get used to it, but I find myself having to turn the Jeep back on to get the phone out.  I get that it is required to have the coolness of a motorized grip.*  Movable arm on suction cup mount doesn't offer enough articulation to get the phone exactly where you want it in every case, but this does offer stabilityThe biggest problem I had was mounting it in a Jeep Wrangler.  This is not the product's fault.  Jeeps just don't have dash space for mounting and the odd air vents didn't work well.  Also, my Jeep has big tires and the vibration was too much for the CD mount.  I ended up just using another ball mount and attaching it to a ProClip dash bar that I already had installed and it works perfectly.  Very stable now and is charging great.  I have added some USB charging ports and I just rand the USB-C line from that to the charger.Overall, I'm only a couple days into using this charger, but it has been great so far and I would recommend it.  If there are any issues with the charger that come up, I will update this review.Edit:  I am about three months into owning this charger and have nothing but good things to say.  It has performed very well and charges my phone quickly.  I had my iPhone in this charger yesterday while in the mountains in my Jeep.  We were on some very rough trails at a high elevation in the Rocky Mountains and it performed like a champ.  It held my phone very securely and I never had an issue with being concerned about it falling out.***********************************************************************************************************************************************I rely on reviews when I make purchases so I put a lot of time into reviewing everything I buy on Amazon for personal and my business.

Although the more heavily “fabric” covered cables appear more stable in the box, there’s been nothing to stop tgem from bending 90 degrees. My husband bought little plastic protectors that were supposed to prevent bending, but not so.Therefore, when I saw these with the one piece “rubber” covering from USB connection down onto the cable, I immediately purchased the 3 pack for 2 phones & an iPad. We need 10’ to reach from the wall to a comfortable position in bed. The one piece construction of the protective covering prevents smashing the phone’s cable against the body or bed breaking the delicate internal filament wiring. It’s stiff enough to prevent careless positioning yet flexible as well such that the phone moves with ease during any movement.These are the best charging cables I’ve ever seen & are a third of the cost of one “sturdy” cable purchased elsewhere. If you like to read in bed, this well constructed charging cable is the Best Buy around. We’ve had ours for only a couple of months, but that was easily enough time for the flimsy white Apple cables which are very expensive for 6’ to already show permanent bend lines in the white vinyl portending the cable’s demise in short order. The more durable cable on the “heavy duty” 10’ cords were beginning to show fiber tears at the connection point in 2 months.

I have owned a small business for almost three decades and use alot of mobile devices to get things done.  In particular, I rely on phones and laptop/tablets wherever I am.  In fact, I generally won't buy a cell phone for myself or my employees unless Zerolemon makes a battery case for it because I have never had a cell phone that could last a full day of real use.  Over the years, I have found Zerolemon products to be well made, functional, and backed by an unbeatable warranty and customer service.When I return home from remote working, my mobile devices end up on my desk and it has become a jumble of wires and power bricks.  Worse yet, when I travel I have a dizzying array of power bricks and cords and there are always so few available plugs in hotel rooms i now carry multiple with me.  At my office, I quit using a desktop computer a couple of years ago, so I have a laptop with a docking station and tablet PC, phone, hotspot, mouse, external hard drives, etc. right on  and around my desk.  Everything needs a charge.  That is why, when I saw this product, I had to have one.It does not disappoint.The charger comes in a nondescript but nice black box, and is well protected by a foam cushion inside.  It comes with the main device, a power cord, a Zerolemon giveaway card and warranty card, and an instruction/specification booklet.  I'll be honest, I tossed all of that aside for now because I wanted to give it a try as quickly as possible. I did not read any of it and just plugged it in.The main unit is a matte finish--I ordered the black one.  The station is very sturdy.  I am not going to do it, but I am sure I could stand on it without inflicting any damage.  On the front (see the pictures) you have the USB-C ports, USB-A ports, an on/off button, a power light and a voltage light.  I did not see the power light until I plugged it in, but it is a discreet green light that poinds toward the desk surface.  In other words, it would not keep you awake on a bedside table, but you can tell it is workng from the soft green glow.  I did not see the voltage light until I used the first USB-C plug to charge my Thinkpad laptop with extended battery (the 20v light came on; there is a 15v light, too).My Lenovo Thinkpad can be a little finicky about a charge.  Like many newer computers, it charges from a USB-C port on the computer, and I generally get a \"slow charging\" notice from anything other than the factory charger.  Not this time.  It is happily charging at full capacity while I am using the computer and several attached USB items through a hub, including a lit keyboard and three USB (spinning) hard drives that are all drawing power from the USB-A 3.0 port on the computer.  That is alot of power.  The Zerolemon unit is not warm.  Though it has cutouts for fans, they came on for a very short time despite all of the other things I also have plugged in.  The fans are very quiet.There are nice rubber feet on the bottom of the unit and it sits perfectly flat on my desk.What else am I charging at the same time?  Another finicky charging product: a Microsoft Surface Pro.  It is not giving me a slow charging warning, either!  I am using the charging dongle from my car charger for that one plugged into a USB-A port.I am also charing a Samsung S9+ from a USB-C port.I am also charging my Note 10+ wirelessly on the top of the unit (see picture--circle).I am charging my wife's Apple Watch on the dimple on the top.Finally, I am charging my Samsung Galaxy Watch with the wireless charger plugged into the last USB-A port.Nothing is giving me a slow charging warning.To be clear, I am charging SIX items at once from this single device and it is not even warm.  I separately charged my son's Macbook Pro and iPad and they also charged with no slow charging warnings.  Now he wants one (he is all Apple, all of the time: computer, tablet, watch, phone, and earbuds).I just replaced six plugs/power-bricks with one plug!  I am sure this is designed for bedside use, too (I just ordered a white one for my wife for that very purpose and another black one for my son) but it is great for a cluttered desk and I have no doubt it will be great traveling, too.I put my Samsung earbud case on the round charging spot and it charges wirelessly. My bug Zerolemon 1000mah case charges wirelessly on it, too.My last purchase was a Zerolemon USB-C wall brick that provides full charging power to my large Samsung Note 10+ phone.  This item is even better because it does the same and charges five other devices at the same time.My first cell phone was a radio phone with a rotary dial in my car and a huge whip antenna on the trunk. Then I progressed to a bag phone.  Then a brick phone, then Blackberries, etc. on down the line.  I have been doing my best with mobile products that have to be charged for well over three decades.  If I didn't like this device I would just return it without any regret.  As is, I like it very much and am leaving this review so others may be encouraged to give it a try.A quality charge station.  This is the sort of do-everything, quality-build, charging station that you would find in a high end hotel, but it has the additional capacity to charge really big items like computers.Super impressed.\n","id":"00a16bda-c0e0-4e21-9dcf-7b802a119ca4"},{"text":"\n  I was looking at those fancy new GAN power bricks then I bumped into this and thought I should just get this.  Granted it's not as small as the GAN chargers but it comes with 4 ports, dual USB-C PD (87W/20W), and dual USB-A 3A.-Size-wise it's about double the size of a 90-100W GAN charger.  You can see the size comparison in both my photos.  One showing an Apple watch and S20 Ultra and another showing Airpods Pro.-The 87W USB-C is enough to support all MacBooks and most laptops up to mid-tier.  However, it's not powerful enough for higher-end gaming machines like my Razerblade 15 which is a given as that laptop has a 240W proprietary power adapter.-Love that the power LED is not a blinding blue LED but rather a subtle green glowing below the power button.-While one of the stock photos show it supports Apple Watches up to series 3, that is incorrect as I have a series 5 and it charges perfectly fine as you can see from my photo.  The 10W wireless charging works as intended.  A shame it's not the 15W variant but if you have a iPhone then it doesn't matter anyways since they only support up to 10W and that's if you're lucky as  iOS is notorious for reducing the charging speeds if the phone starts to get hot.  The dual fans are so quiet I had to double-check that they were working.  Lol-It's always nice to have a power button as we should all do our part to conserve power whenever we can as it's not a matter of affording the power bill or not but being environmentally conscious.-While I've always been a fan of the texture they chose for the top, this kind of matte black, it's a fingerprint magnet.  I'm a bit OCD so I always have to wipe it from time to time as I use the wireless charging slots.All in all, another fine charger by Zerolemon.  It's not cheap but it's comparable to buying two of those fancy GAN chargers but you only take up one 2-prong power socket.\n","id":"53d39c0a-7672-4a78-9f97-573d7f61793c"},{"text":"\n  I have multiple devices at home on my work table. With this charging station, I'm able to charge my laptop, two cell phones and bluetooth headset at the same time and eliminate a bunch of wall adapters from hogging up all my outlets. My laptop and phones are using USB C ports. I plugged the laptop into the first USB C port since it has the most power. My laptop's charging time was also identical to using the original charger. I plugged one of the phones into the USB A port and the other into the USB C. Both were able to be quick charged since they are QC 3.0 phones. My phones also support wireless charging and although I'm usually not a fan of using Qi charging, this one worked out well. When placed on top of the left side my phone detected it and started to charge. What's even better is that it shows it as quick charging. Most Qi chargers I've used in the past are very slow to charge. This one is almost as quick as charging using a cable but just a tad behind.Overall, a good charging station for those who have multiple devices that need to be charged.

It worked well enough for about a year and suddenly stopped working. I bought this one to replace it and it isn’t as finicky as my other one was about receiving a connection.

My sister has been loving it ever since I gave it to her since I was still rocking an iPhone 6 at the time and did not have any use for it and she has an iPhone 8. I basically just used her as a guinea pig to satisfy my curiosity about wireless charging. Well, fast forward to a few months later and I got a good deal on an iPhone 8 (I'm not THAT much of an iOS fan to shell out over $1,000.00 for an iPhone X or XS), and here we are, reviewing this nice combo from Anker. We'll start by reminding you a little about what she said about the Pad itself:\"Starting from the package, simple and to the point. It comes with a USB cable, does not include AC adapter, but used my Anker 4 port wall charger. The size is a bit larger than the palm of my hand, extra lightweight, smooth surface. When I read the instruction booklet it clearly said it has to be centered in order to charge, I have an iPhone 8, so I tried tricking it and it can be a little to the left or to the right or a little more upwards or downwards, just not to the point where it might flip, so the charging range is good. It has a small blue indicator that lets you know when it's charging, it may also indicate if the temperature rises, hasn't happened so far. It fully charges around 3-3.5 hours. So it’s practical just lay it there to charge before bedtime on your nightstand.\"I've gotta say that I agree 100% with that. Again, this bundle does not include a charging brick bud does include 2 Micro USB cables (3ft each). And it's not like I don't have power options all over the house. Several original iPhone and Samsung chargers as well as a BUNCH of Anker chargers and power strips with USB ports. So, no worries there. If you are not as well equipped, worry not, you can get an Anker EliteDual Port 24W Wall Charger at Amazon ($10.99 before taxes and shipping at the time of this post). So once you have the needed  accessories out of the way, we can dive into the other half of this duo, which is the Stand.The footprint for the stand is smaller than the pad, I ended up placing the stand on my desk and the pad on my nightstand. It has a convenient LED on the front to let you know that you have successfully \"docked\" your phone. The light would be annoying to have on a nightstand, plus I really don't need the phone angled toward me while I'm sleeping, especially since I keep it on \"Do Not Disturb\" during bedtime. So no big loss there for me, plus, it's very convenient to have it angled that way on my desk so that I can monitor calls since I usually have it on silence during work hours and I can see at a glance who is calling, all while conveniently charging my phone and being able to just pick it up if I have to leave without messing with cables or worrying about them just being everywhere.So all that being said, I'd like to remind you that wireless charging is a bit wasteful on energy and you will not achieve the same charging speeds as a regular charger. Simple style, functionality and a small footprint. As always, Anker's 18-month warranty and Power IQ technology make this an easy purchase decision for the wary buyer.\n","id":"43f9f7f8-5fae-4106-8765-84a74e640727"},{"text":"\n  Final update: I tried it again last night and after connecting it gave 4 or 5 battery charging alerts in a span of 2 minutes.

I tried to evaluate Anker cables & both chargers vs Samsung adapter, and swapping in Anker adapter I also bought.As best I could tell in short term evaluations, these touch chargers are 30% less effective at best, than using a cable directly to phone. Regardless of cable or adapter configuration.The most frustrating aspect of my attempted trial was that after 10 minutes of monitoring, my AccuBattery app froze, and I had to close it, re-open it, and I lost all evaluation data. This ocurred so often that I can't figure out which is to blame?  AccuBattery app, or Anker. They are both highly rated on sites, but they don't play nicely, or in the same sandbox. Avoid one or the other.AccuBattery app has seemed to be great. Anker package above was the new addition to the environment. I blame all this on Anker.I will say the results I was able to document before it all became a headache, was that this bundle charges at best, at 66% of the high speed Aukey cable I bought 2 years ago, and the OEM Samsung adapter that came with my phone 3 years ago.My middle of the road rating would have advised me not to purchase.Keep smilingJohn\n","id":"4a7a9360-8cc7-4114-a903-0ffbc8d36284"},{"text":"\n  Works great for our iPhones X.

I have been looking for its replacement ever since.The Pros:This multi-charger is working exactly as described. It accommodates my iPhone X (with its thin case), AirPod Pros (as well as original AirPods and AirPods 2), and my Apple Watch series 4 (as well as girlfriend’s series 3).  Mine did not come with a charger, but for the price, that is acceptable. With my charger, all three items charge fast and completely (there is no excessive heat generated on any item). The fact that it can, not only, support multiple angles for phone and watch, but fold completely flat for travel, is a great added bonus!  Mine has a blue/red led light to indicate charging/power. I like the red vice the green because it is not very bright at night.The Cons:The blue led is too bright for me at night, but a little black electrical tape solved that. So not that big of a deal (certainly not a dealbreaker). I found that if I put my watch on the charger before my phone, my phone won’t charge. Easily remedied by placing the phone on the charger before the watch. This is the reason for 4 out of 5 stars for ease of use, but I would gladly give 4.7 stars if that was possible.Final verdict: Don’t hesitate to buy!\n","id":"2386a646-9202-4713-b1c1-10711783996d"},{"text":"\n  My cellphone has had problems with plugging into chargers.

It can double up as a emergency charger too.Very satisfied with this as It can do the job well without having a high price tag\n","id":"c89d55e4-e51a-45a8-9f85-26d1acb94517"},{"text":"\n  Received this pair of earbuds in a couple of days and was immediately satisfied with what I got. Sound was great, with a fair amount of bass. Not too thumpy or overpowering. The case is made from a sturdy plastic that came in a matte finish. Doesn't feel cheap at all. For someone that relies on their phone throughout the day, having the option to use the case as a powerbank was a huge plus point too!The most underrated feature in this, to be honest, is the option to use a single earbud in mono mode. As the earbuds did a fairly good job at insulating outside noises, mono mode allowed me to stay aware of my surrounding while commuting or at the gym.Can't be happier with my order!\n","id":"4ab932c1-fea7-4e11-8f2c-5971bd571bca"},{"text":"\n  After using this for a few weeks in various activities like gym workouts, outdoor jogging, outdoor cycling and music on-the-go, this earbuds with ear-wings/fins did a good job of securely fitting for the ear during indoor and outdoor activities. It’s IPX7 water resistant rating also protects it from rain and sweat.Pairing is easy and straightforward as it uses Bluetooth v5.0 with Apple or Samsung Galaxy phones or any devices with either one or two earbuds for mono or stereo use. Receiving audio calls is clear and loud and has a great audio soundstage for music listening. Battery lifespan is a happy surprise for you due to longer hours as compared to hoursThe TrueShift 2 touch controls support full audio playback, volume control, calls (including call switching), voice assistant and you can turn the earbuds on and off manually.One plus point is that the carrying case can double-up as a 3000mAh powerbank to charge your smartphone as and when it requires besides charging the earbuds. Just remember to bring along your phone charging cable.This kit includes the earbuds, clampshell design charging case, a USB-C cable, 2 pairs of ear-tips, and 2 pairs of ear-fins. It also includes a user manual and very confident that you won’t need to refer to it.In my opinion, if you are looking for a mid-range earbuds then this is a very good buy as compared to other Brand’s in terms of overall performance.\n","id":"4a55318d-2e1f-4aa9-8bd9-0b1632b7042a"},{"text":"\n  I connected this earbuds with my iPad Pro 11 second generation and the sound quality is superior with a very nice bass, clear treble and very clear mids and highs.

Definitely highly recommended as the sound can rival other higher priced competitions. An excellent product for this price point.\n","id":"446a7df9-f9a6-4788-b9a8-27c359f044c6"},{"text":"\n  Call me a headset junkie , was truly impressed with this Soundpeats Trueshift 2 . Coming from the Airpods pro , Bose sound sports free and the Samsung Galaxy buds.The others cost so much more than the soundpeats and naturally they sound good but what I was truly impressed with the soundpeats was it's price and  relatively good sound profile for a workout headset.I mostly used it for running and in the gym, it provides just the right amount of bass, suitable for EDM and Club type genre. Mids and treble was good. The IPX7 rating helps if you're the sweaty type.Would be good to have  an ambient aware mode, but that would also mean the cost of the headset would be higher.Call quality was good both ways , was able to hear the caller clearly. Caller said that my voice was clear however sounded a bit distant.Was able to use the headset independently, and when reconnecting the headsets it was a breeze.Controls was intuitive, single tap to the right bud will increase the volume and left bud will decrease the volume.Double tap will play and pause the music.Tap and hold the right bud to go to the next song and the previous song with the left bud.Double tap will also answer and hang up calls .The headset also comes with 3 pairs of ear fins and ear tips. The ones that was installed on the buds ( mid size)  provided a snug fit for me ,however my ears started to ache when wearing the headset for a prolonged period. Guess that happens with most headsets. Swapped to the smaller fin. Hopefully it works.Battery life was good enough for a few gym session. Battery percentage dropped  about 10% when  listening for about an hour with mid volume.Headset profile is also quite discreet unlike the Bose soundsport free.  Does not protrude from the ears.The other advantage is the case doubles as a emergency phone charger. It has a 3000mah  battery to charge the ear buds and provides an emergency power source when your phone runs out of juice.Truly happy with my purchase, a true value for money.\n","id":"a8adf7ee-6676-4cc6-95eb-e6441a136faa"},{"text":"\n  Iterm received in good condition.

It continuously stops and starts charging my Note 8 no matter what position i put it in, even without a case. I am using the cable and charger provided from iottie as well.I feel that this is an inferior product as my wireless charges at home and office work perfectly so I know the problem is not with my phone but the charger itselfI been using wireless charging Iottie products before and they work great, but noticed that the phone would discharge if using maps and streaming pandora, so I got this fast wireless charger to prevent that.I used the included power adapter and placed my Note 8 with a slim case on the charger. I did move the  bottom bracket all the way down per the instructions.Placed the phone on the charger and went for a ride.I did notice the fast wireless charging message on the screen, so so far so good, but a few minutes after I noticed the wireless charging beep/message pop up on the screen again. It was still charging.. Few minutes later, same thing. This behavior repeated many times.So I did an experiment.I removed the case from the phone and placed it on the charger. Now it was going a longer time before the charging message would pop up.Lastly, i removed the bottom bracket of the charger, placed the case on the phone and put the phone just a tad lower on the charger than the bottom  bracket would have allow. To give you an idea, the left pad of the charger, was pressing half of the bixby button (i have bixby deactivated)I found that this position, the wireless charging would activate and work flawlessly for a very long time.Is possible that due to the size of the note 8, plus putting a case that would slightly move the phone higher (due to the bottom bumper of the case) and put it right at the edge of the coils, which made the charger go in and out.It is unfortunate that Iottie did not include a longer bottom bracket to allow the Note 8 to match with the charging coils.I cannot use the phone without a case and not using the bottom bracket and trying to align the phone each time is a huge hassle, so I will continue to use it like it is now  and ignore the charging beeps that come on frequently.\n","id":"7cd6f365-9332-4a1b-9213-e1457c159ed1"},{"text":"\n  POSITION PROPERLY - Awesome Works perfectly- but just a heads up for iPhone 8, 8 plus and iPhone X users if you don’t position the mount properly your phone will show charging but it will discharge slowly- to avoid this position so the apple logo is visible above the mount from the back, adjust the legs or the base accordingly so you don’t have to do it more than once.

Its fits my large phone with a case on it with room to spare. I like the CD player mount option as well as being able to use in portrait or landscape mode. It's easy in and easy out with one hand and it's much better that having to fiddle with a charger or a finicky mount. I haven't had my phone fall out and don't see that as being a problem in the future :)Some less than awesome aspects of it:#1 it doesn't fast charge my Samsung Note 5 which is wireless fast charge capable and works on other chargers. I reached out to the seller and couple of days ago and haven't gotten a response back on why it's doing this (or what I'm doing wrong) That is pretty disappointing because wireless fast charging was one of the reasons I decided to go with this particular product.#2 It's pretty jiggly when driving, that being said, I'm sure it could be much worse but I also think it could be better. I have this problem even with the extra piece that's supposed to make it more snug. I'm not watching movies while driving so I'll get over it. It seems pretty okay but for $50 I want it to be better. I feel like I may have been just as satisfied with the $25 standard wireless charging one available on Amazon.I'd consider returning it if I could get it out of CD player but that clip is so \"secured\" I'm not about to break a nail over exchanging it for something cheaper. Mind you the clip was easy to remove without the extra snugging piece, the extra piece didn't seem to make much difference in jiggliness in my car though, so I'd probably not use it in hindsight.

Hands-down, one all around solid product. I definitely recommend if you’re looking to upgrade your charging station.\n","id":"b1164aff-74f9-476f-b4bc-b86c28ea6bfb"},{"text":"\n  Lamp works. I like that it swivels though direction is limited. Whole contraption is not very heavy, so the base moves if I'm reaching over to adjust while I'm in bed. The main reason I purchased this is because it was 2 in 1 (with multiple phone charging options). I never could get my phone to charge using the rotating tool on the front of the base, but that's not the part I intended to use anyway. I simply wanted to lay my phone on the base and charge; this was spotty at best. I would move the phone around, took off the case, etc. It never simply worked immediately. And when it does charge, it makes a strange high-pitched whistling sound sort of like static on a TV but higher. Very odd and not worth the trouble. I'm returning it. Seller accepted return request quickly, so hopefully the return will go as expected.\n","id":"9d670f4a-0f0a-4cb6-ae46-fea48a9b37c9"},{"text":"\n  I love this lamp!  Well worth the money. It has helped me focus on my reading material, and being able to change brightness and hues, enables me to tailor the hue/brightness  to my environment and what I'm currently reading.Some other notable features are: adjustable arm, brightness control, phone charging module, and touch control to turn off and on.I had a little problem with the digital display, but support returned my email with in the hour and solved that issue within a few minutes.\n","id":"90b0ebc4-c5c4-44f2-a4d7-a6d549585a62"},{"text":"\n  I purchased this product last week, and it arrived exactly on time. In the 3 days that I've had this, I've grown to love it. The endless customizable features make this an exceptional product. The display is linked to the motion sensing light on the front (which they don't tell you up front, but it's not a big deal). The display is also very bright. This lamp sits on my nightstand, and the first night I was about blinded by the display alone. Fortunately there is an on/off switch that will allow you to turn it off. Also, the motion sensor has a cover to prevent it being constantly activated when you don't want it to.The one drawback is when you go rotate the top portion. The battery & battery cover kept popping out every time I rotated it due to a warping of the plastic housing. This caused me to reset the display 4 times before I realized why it was happening. This was easily solved with some duct tape over the cover that blends into the grey housing. No more problems, and I still thoroughly love this lamp!\n","id":"6d61b124-b2b2-4b6d-a767-083c2d4bd33d"},{"text":"\n  I love this lamp, even recommended to a friend who purchased 3 of them. I haven't experienced any of the complaints by other reviewers. My only issue with this lamp is that it doesn't have a battery backup for memory to save the time settings. Any time it is unplugged, especially accidentally, you have to re-set the whole darn thing all over again. A tedious inconvenience over something so trivial. Also, I wish the back-lit display had more color options to set and choose from. Not to mention same for the actual light, like those hue lights you can change the colors of. Last but not least...for the amount of this thing it should come with a built-in Bluetooth speaker like their other version for that's about $98. My hope is they'll make another one, maybe a version 3 to include all of my recommendations. #FingersCrossed\n","id":"13eaa2cf-0f55-4174-adfc-289e7fb6aa66"},{"text":"\n  All the features work as described, satisfied.

If you have a crease anywhere in the braided part it can wear and break. More frustratingly, the charger actually slips out of the port on my phone. I think this is because the plug is too small. This becomes really annoying because when it jiggles around it’s like unplugging and plugging your phone so it just vibrates a lot.

The biggest reason is that it is a stand alone charger, so there is no need to insert your own charger into another piece (basically a stand) like other “chargers” require. The power source is USB so I can plug it directly in to my wall outlets that have USB plugs or use a charging cube or charging pack when I travel.

It takes up little room on my nightstand.-I feel like the price was really fair.-It works with a bumper/screen protector.Cons:-It doesn’t come with an adapter to plug into your socket.-The watch is warm in the morning when I take it off the charger, which is a little concerning, but that’s happened with other chargers I’ve had and it hasn’t been a problem.-The bottom of the charger isn’t very grippy, so it slides around.I really love this charger! I’ve had it for a little over a month and have used it every night I bought it because I lost the charger that my watch came with. This watch comes with a cord that plugs into the charger stand, then into your adapter. Be aware that it doesn’t come with an adapter, and you don’t need a different watch charging cable for this.After comparing this charger with others like it, I feel like this was the right purchase for me.

The leather finish gives it a really sophisticated look, and I plan on keeping it in the conference room at work.  Being able to charge three devices at once it pretty awesome.  I am guessing that the challenges of charging that many devices from one power-supply make it so that it does not fast-charge.  Still, it does charge three devices in prompt fashion and although I can’t measure the output current, it doesn’t feel any slower than any other wireless charger.  I guess because there is only one coil per slot, the phones have to be lined up just right, but it’s not hard to do at all, and as you can see in my photo, all three phones charge fine with cases on them.\n","id":"3d109a65-b259-4088-96ea-149a8f28bb1a"},{"text":"\n  Product has the perfect size and it charges even  With heavy covers on phones, love the  Charging station.\n","id":"a823e2e9-9150-4ed0-8f38-222bc8c6ab84"},{"text":"\n  This charger is so fast!

With practice, this becomes automatic.If your phone/device doesn't come with wireless charging, there are aftermarket add-ons that are little more than a sticker with wires.

It works and charges at a normal speed. The only issue I had depends on the case you use for the phone. If you are using the standard silicone cases most people use you should be fine.

The included booklet was worthless because it was only in Chinese.  Doing a web search got me the manual in English which helped a lot.First make sure your cube has charged a few hours before using. Download the Giiker app from your phone's store. Make sure location and bluetooth is turned on on your phone. Open the app and right before you click on connect cube start using your cube. This will make sure it isn't in sleep mode and help pair with your phone. Do not connect directly to your phone, instead do it via the app if you intend to use the app.With all that said for my needs the app is almost worthless. The app only has the beginner method course. Let me tell you what makes this cube superb for my needs. There are websites such as briefcubing.com that let you practice hundreds of CFOP, Roux, COLL, etc. algorithms.  You connect your cube on the website and practice your choice of algorithms there. This is great! You do not need to have your cube scrambled to the presented cases. You simply view the case presented on the site and then execute the correct moves on the cube.  Some people even remove the stickers from the cube and simply use it as a controler for such websites.I also enjoy the clicks that the cube makes when you turn it and the magnets align. It bugs some people but I find it highly satisfying.\n","id":"726b0746-71b6-4804-ad72-5de730e7fcc0"},{"text":"\n  The puzzle makes a click over time it's rotated. The magnets are loose inside.

I don't recommend gluing the magnets down. It really changes the feel of the cube.As for the Bluetooth part, it works. Tracks well. Does what it says it does.Only thing I want fixed is the learning part. I wish there was a learning part for algorithms. Like choose the algorithm and drill it till u learn it. Or learn cross faster.. That would be nice and very helpful. And it needs more orientation. It only has 3.Ultimately it is cool and I like it. Needs afew add on things.Oh big issue.

I like how when the alarm goes off, it starts real quiet and gradually over the course of about a minute gets loud, so it doesn't jolt you out of your sleep and makes you want to punch someone. Also, where the large snooze button is, when your phone is on the top charging, it covers it up. But all you have to do is tap your phone and it will activate the snooze.The only thing I've noticed is the wireless charging is real touchy. I can put my phone on the top, and my phone will make the beep like it's charging, and it will show the little charging symbol in the battery percentage...but it won't charge. I have two other devices that will charge my phone wirelessly at home and work, and I don't have issues with those. But you have to make sure the red charging indicator on the face of the clock is blinking. Even if you have your phone dead square on center it won't always charge. So that is something to be watchful of when you place it on the top to charge at night.\n","id":"17f09db2-feec-44f9-9604-4724c4a006f7"},{"text":"\n  After approximately 45 days of owning this clock, the wireless charging stopped working. I am very disappointed, because it was so convenient to place my phone on top to charge it instead of having to plug it in.I love the size and functionality of this clock. The speaker is great too! The dimmer is a great feature as well. The first night I thought I had it set in the lowest dimmer setting and I was about to return it because it was way too bright. However, the next night I discovered the lowest dimmer setting, now it’s perfect.\n","id":"1af448cd-b0dd-4cf2-92b7-834e2e5b6005"},{"text":"\n  The alarm clock has two alarms that you can set for weekday only, weekend only or everyday.  Great for someone that has different wake up times on the weekend or for two people that wake up at different times on the same day.  The dimmer function gets REALLY low.  No one should be complaining about how bright this model is if they set it all the way to the lowest setting.  The time sets itself as long as your initial set up is for the correct time zone.  The person complaining that this function is worthless in Arizona (or other places that dont participate in DST) may not realize that there is  a \"zone\" for them and the automatic time setting feature is still useful if the electricity goes out and back on while you are sleeping.  The clock will set itself back to the correct time AND your alarm times are saved by the backup battery (included).  Sound great right?  well I can get all of these features in another clock, what I really wanted was dual alarm, automatic time AND WIRELESS charging.  The wireless charger stops charging anywhere from 5 second to 5 minutes after placing the phone in the correct area.  The indicator will blink slowly if it is charging and quickly if there is some kind of problem.  It starts blinking quickly soon after being placed on the charger.  I have tried all of the trouble shooting options and used more than one phone with the same results\n","id":"6cf2c5fc-00e2-4bc7-8b8d-9da19aff1163"},{"text":"\n  Love the size of this unit – other wireless chargers I’ve used take up a lot of space but this fits nicely on my nightstand .

They thought of everything, and I appreciate the details.Modern looks without going overboard with blue leds or anything like that, thank you!

So to release its simple and you don't even really think of the button at all.Went from the one touch iottie 2 to this and wow, worth the wait skipping all the other models for this.

The suction cup is durable and sticks well to windshields and dashboards. The adjustable joints make sure that your phone always stays in the same spot while driving. My favorite accessory is the auto sense clamp around the phone. No more pulling your phone off the clamp and damaging your phone case and mount. It adjusts perfectly to your phone and it extremely convenient when you want to take the phone off the mount. With all these amazing features, I didn’t even get to the fact that it CHARGES YOUR PHONE TOO!!!  The charge has lightening speed. Fully charged my phone within 1 hour. Stop buying cheap car mounts like I used to, purchase this mount and never worry again.\n","id":"6ed55836-0a55-42d0-b02c-bfb85fa5c2fa"},{"text":"\n  This thing is amazing! I just started DoorDash/Uber eats and needed some type of mount so I could see my phone. I opted with the clamp style vs the magnetic as I read some reviews that if you have a heavier phone (I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max) that sometimes your phone can flip upside down or completely fall off and I do not want to risk the phone either falling in the middle of a drove or fall and crack the screen. So I got this clamp map and it works 100% of the time. Every time you put the phone up to the clamp it will auto open and you just set the phone in the clamp and it auto closes and I will tell you it holds the phone tight, it’s not going anywhere. If for any reason you loose power then you can easily pry the clamp open to get your device. The air vent mount holds onto the vent fairly tightly so I’m not worried about my phone going anywhere. Overall I am very happy with this car mount and highly recommend it. PS: I saw someone posted this can’t keep the phone charged while the screen is on, while using DoorDash/Uber eats and Waze with the screen on full brightness it does charge the phone, slower than normal since your using a lot of power but it will charge the phone and keep it charged.\n","id":"7240bf67-ea4b-47e2-b348-d3445a9824e0"},{"text":"\n  First off love this company really great customer service.

I was disappointed to discover that the silver color refers to just the thin rim around the edge of the unit. From the picture I thought the whole pad would be silver, but it is just white, which still looks fantastic. The light is green when on and blue when a device is placed on it. Without a phone or device covering the led indicators, it may be a bit bright for sensitive sleepers, but after my phone is placed, only a soft glow, virtually nonexistent, surrounds the base. The bases diameter is wide enough that I don't have to worry about my phone sliding off; a welcome feature versus my last charging pad.\n","id":"9255258d-96e9-4e4d-be58-d751beae86a4"},{"text":"\n  The product looks nice when you get it but unfortunately it would work on or off ... i would wake up in the morning and my phone didn’t charge and sometimes it did.

After a few minutes it would stop charging.  I began to fiddle with it, trying to find the charging \"sweet spot\".  Futile.  I tried borrowing my wife's 2 yr old much larger Samsung charging stand - and that worked!  After a few more tries on this one, I gave up on Native Union.  (To make matters worse, Amazon tried forcing me to wait in line at a Kohls for a return. We ended up calling Amazon's Customer Service to do the return via UPS simple drop off.)UPDATE: I replaced this one with a simple Anker upright rectangular stand. OMG it works so much better... even when my phone is poorly positioned, even with a protective case (a thin one) on it. Native Union needs to get their act together.

I used to have one of the charging stands where you had to weave all your existing charge wires through the stand so I ended up with a completely full surge protector, but this solved my insane wire problems!It does exact what it's supposed to do -- all my devices are charging, even my iphone 11 pro with the popsocket base still on my 2mm case.  I did try charging my phone with my popsocket top attached, and it doesn't work.  The light just flickers back and forth between red and blue.Sure, with a regular charge adapter that comes with your phone is really slow at charging all 4 devices which is to be expected, but I'm sure the QC 3.0 adapter will help (I have yet to get one).  Besides, when I'm sitting at my desk and need to charge my phone, I'm usually working and will be for several hours and don't need an instant charge for my phone.  We're all sitting at home anyway, so I'm not really in a rush lol.  Also, the box comes with a charging cable, so no worries there.I will say that the only gripe I have (if I HAVE to have one and I'm being picky) is that the black rubber base for where the phone sits to keep it from sliding off of the base isn't the most secure.  I do have to adjust my phone a little bit to make sure it doesn't slip off, but it's nothing that I'm actually complaining about.  I'm sure if you don't have the popsocket base at the back of your phone, the phone won't slip around.  You can also adjust the angle that your phone sits at with the little kickstand at the back of the phone/watch panel, so that helps a lot too!  I like that the kickstand is a solid metal piece and there's some magnetism going on with its contact with the charging base that keeps it from collapsing (the ability to collapse this entire stand for travel is another awesome feature!).Overall, I'm really happy with this charging stand!  It does everything it's supposed to do, plus the rose gold is a really cute color that no other 4-in-1 charging stand seller has.  The rose gold color doesn't have the issue that the white stand seems to have with the charge light being obnoxiously bright or shining through the base itself.  If I were you and considering this charging stand, this is the perfect one!  It'll definitely serve me well even if I decide to upgrade my airpods, watch, or phone.

No cons, I could not find a single one for this gun, where I am very happy with the purchase.\n","id":"76e49182-5c12-48a3-a4cd-9aacacc3ee76"},{"text":"\n   I work in a therapy clinic that has physical and occupational therapy services and massage guns are really a great tool. Typically our physicla therapists and physical therapy assistants would gice manual massages but this massage gun is a grrat way to not only save time but it's so much more effective. This is a really nice one and one thing worth noting is that the lowest speed has 640 rpm. It's really nice to have this lower speed option since our patient's are kids and it's a much slower rpm then the highest level which is 3200 percussions per minute. All together thr massage gun has 5 speeds and the LCD touch screen shows thr battery life percentage and the lights on the side indicate the speed.In addition to coming in a nice and portable zip up case this massage gun has 6 different head attachments which work different parts of the body. We have some patient's with some really high muscle tone that get very tight and sore and this massage gun has been nothing short of amazing! Easy for anyone to use it comes with instructions and of course youtube videos are always available.  Really a great tool!\n","id":"79e95cfd-6ae2-4a81-a91d-71bab5528e47"},{"text":"\n   Very good massage machine to relax the  muscle. I always having problems on my legs, had always free sour. This machine definitely works very well. I feel so relax after use it.\n","id":"45eb6fcf-a916-4294-b865-5eb54046a98a"},{"text":"\n  Searching through Amazon, here are the reason why I chose this massage gun over the others.1) PriceI paid $149.99 minus the $20 coupon at the time of my purchase. I think at this mid-price point it is very reasonable. I found some other massage gun are below the hundred dollars price range but those look like they are cheaply made base from the pictures and comments. On the other hands, some massage gun are over the two hundred dollars price range, which I think they're overpriced and also out of my budget.2) QualityIt's well built. It uses high quality plastic that does not feel cheap. Weight is well balance on the hand at 2lbs, it does not feel heavy even holding it for long time. Brushless motor is smooth and quiet that does not produce much heat even using it for over 15-20 minutes of continuous use.3) BatteryI received the massage gun with a full charge battery at 100%. It drops only 5% after several session of 15-20 minutes of use.4) HeadsIt comes with 7 different heads that target at different muscles groups, which is perfect for what I needed.5) PowerIt comes with 5 different power level, which controls by the touch button. Level 3 is what I would use most of the time and it did give a good powerful punch to loosen the tight muscles right after my home workout.There is a physical power switch (flipping left to turn off, right to turn on) at the bottom of the handle to prevent the massage gun from accidentally turn on by the touch button - a good safety feature to prevent battery drain.6) ConclusionIt comes with the charger, cool looking carbon fiber pattern case with foam cushioning inside to store all the 7 heads/charges/massage gun/instruction manual. Overall, I think it met my expectation and it is a great massage gun IMO.\n","id":"746b22cb-770e-4ed0-b5e8-22604d41a521"},{"text":"\n  I have to admit that I am a longtime fan of SONOS, although I do think that I have dealt my share of constructive criticism over the years. When it comes to the SONOS MOVE, I think they have made a home run!Here is what I like:1. It sounds amazing! Here's why - The bass is significant, even outside, without ever getting distorted. It plays really loud if you want, but also sounds well balanced at low sound levels. They did something amazing with the high-frequency and mid-range where is sounds uniform across the entire side and forward projection of the speaker, not just in the \"sweet spot\" in front like other speakers. It is beautifully detailed and realistic sounding.2. It looks great. Here's why - It has the same great looks as I have come to expect from SONOS, but there is something about the material choices on this product that make it even better. It fits right in with my other SONOS speakers, while not taking up any more space than say a SONOS ONE.3. Automatic Trueplay - it automatically adjusts its sound depending on where you place the speaker, making sure that it always sound its best. I imagine this was pretty had to do, but it works really well. I put MOVE in some pretty challenging places inside and outside, and within 20 or 30 seconds or so it just fixes itself and sounds great again!4. The WiFi range - I took MOVE outside and began to walk all around the outside my house and into the yard pretty far away and it never lost connection. SONOS did something special here with the WiFi to make it super robust.5. Bluetooth - even if you go some place without WiFi, you can still connect with Bluetooth. I like having that feature so that I don't have to worry if there is WiFi or not wherever I might travel.6. It feels solid - It has a great solid and balanced feeling to it. There is an integrated handle in the back that is just part of the design. I've set it down on sand and grass and it just feels stable and balanced.7. Stereo pair - I only have one, and with it I can fill my whole yard with incredible sound, but I like knowing that if I ever got another one, I could set them up as a stereo pair and have myself a real outdoor concert!8. It's weather proof - you could get caught in the rain, or it could get dirty and you can just rinse it off with a hose. I plan to take good care of MOVE, but its nice to know that it has this level of protection from the elements.9. It has voice control - just like the SONOS ONE, it has a microphones that allow you to use Alexa and Google voice assistants. That comes in handy, especially when you are outside grilling.10. Charging base - it comes with a nice charging base, instead of it being sold as an accessory like other brands do.What I don't like:1. Travel bag - it comes with a nice looking bag, but I question how long it will last and how much protection it will really give. I'm sure SONOS will offer a travel bag accessory at some point, but for $400, it seems like they could have included a nylon padded bag with handle and pouch for accessories.2. USB-C charger - it is great that it comes with a nice charging base, but if they made the charger a detachable USB-C charger, then you could more easily take it with you when you travel. I'm sure SONOS will probably sell a USB-C charger accessory at some point, but again, for $400, I think this could have been included.Overall, this is one fantastic product. I would say that this is easily the best SONOS product they have ever made. I just love having a\" truly wireless\" wireless speaker!\n","id":"d4b24c78-e79a-4b4f-a76d-f49289876a71"},{"text":"\n  Finally, at long last.....we finally have an outdoor, portable, Bluetooth/wifi Sonos speaker offering. I have Sonos products all over my house, so I will admit I already like their products and I am very familiar with them. This speaker fits perfectly into their lineup for people who want to be able to bring Sonos away from home wifi zones. I'll make this review short and sweet. This speaker is not small....it's probably about twice the volume of a Play One. It's also not light, but it comes with a very well-designed handle. The way I think of this speaker is a new and improved Play 3 that happens to be mobile and battery operated. It has a front-facing driver that sounds very nice and is plenty loud for my taste. It can be paired to another Move speaker if you have a large deck and you don't want to hardwire a stereo setup.What I do with mine is the perfect application, in my opinion. I leave the handy and well-executed charging station where I would have placed a Play 3 in my house. It will operate exactly the same as your other Sonos speaker. When I'm going to use it outside, I simply pick it up and take it with me. The internal wifi extenders means I never have to use Bluetooth when I'm anywhere near my house. I use this on my deck. If I forget to bring it in at night, it will have no issues with a rain storm, a drop into the pool, or a water gun blast.Pros:- Solid speaker loudness and tone. It's not as good as a Play 5, but as good or slightly better than the Play One.- Very well built.- Charging station is nicely done and can remain in a convenient location.- Can be charged with any USB-C plug as well.- 10 hour battery life at 50% volume.Cons:- Price. This is not an inexpensive speaker.- Size and weight. I don't take this to the beach with me. It's a little too big for that and I wouldn't want to risk something of this value at the beach.- It's new, so there are not any aftermarket wall or deck mounts being made yet. I am waiting for a wall-mount for my deck where I can just set it down out of the way.\n","id":"4388c754-1bc7-4cb3-9e6b-d73244cb4d75"},{"text":"\n  Portable (Check), pairable (check), weather resistant (check), Trueplay (check), voice control (check), bluetooth (check), Sonos sound and of course WiFi capability, (Check and Mate).

And speaking of touch, the touch controls on the top of the unit are responsive with a light tap.When it comes to portability, it fell like carrying a gallon of water around.

I guess I’m one of the unfortunate saps whose Surface Type Cover port just isn’t going to work anymore.I read the somewhat alarming Amazon reviews about the misbehaving trackpad on the Fintie Bluetooth keyboard/cover, but I ordered the non-backlit version anyway because I had few other options. It arrived packaged well enough and appeared to be unopened.I’ve had it for just one day, but first things first: it works. I paired it with my Surface without any problems at all. On the downside, keystrokes sound and feel much, much hollower (and louder) on the Fintie than on the Microsoft Type Cover, but at least I can use my Surface on trips again when I’m away from the Surface Dock in my home office. (If you’ve used the Microsoft keyboard, you’ll definitely notice the difference in keystroke sound/feel.)Ominously, the Fintie User Manual states, “Only one device can be actively paired at any time.” This gave me significant pause, because I use a Microsoft ArcTouch mouse (also Bluetooth) when I’m on the road with my Surface. Thank goodness the Fintie keyboard AND the ArcTouch both function normally and simultaneously on my Pro 4.The Fintie trackpad works fine for me – no wild pointer excursions or random text selections. And the trackpad buttons provide left-click and right-click functionality, too. To be honest, I didn’t use the Type Cover trackpad much anyway, so maybe my bar is set low for this feature. The Fintie trackpad seems to work much better than the reviews led me to expect. The trackpad can be disabled by depressing Fn-Alt, which is fine by me since I use the ArcTouch for pointing anyway.I can deal with turning the keyboard on and off and keeping it charged. I can’t deal with a Surface Pro 4 with no portable keyboard at all. I’m happy I found the Fintie.\n","id":"558e8ace-2b21-4ca8-b2ce-66bfedabba0d"},{"text":"\n  The Type Cover to my Surface Pro 3 died a while ago and all the remedies provided online simply didn't work for me. As I'm using my machine mainly for work and there wasn't any bluetooth keyboard lying around in the office (having only one USB port surely didn't help either), I had to use the on-screen keyboard for a week! I like the fact that there's always a touch-screen option on the SP3 but I simply had to get a keyboard.Now back on topic: This bluetooth keyboard works as advertised and as intended. Worked flawlessly with my SP3, just follow the instructions sticker. The keys are a fair bit harder and louder than my original Type Cover though, which I need to adapt to. I prefer softer keys when typing. Some keys, such as the Del button, are also differently placed as compared to the original, which again can be a nuisance at the beginning. The trackpad is also a bit wonky. Don't get me wrong, it works alright, but not as consistent as the original (which in my opinion isn't the greatest trackpad to begin with). Since i'm using it as a workstation, my wireless mouse basically solves this issue.I haven't had the chance to test its battery life though, but given that the SP3 charging brick has a USB charging port, it really isn't much of a problem. I can just use the Micro USB cable provided (yes, mine came with it) and charge the keyboard through the power brick. The battery on the SP3 doesn't last more than 4-5 hours anyway, so I don't think this keyboard's battery life will be an issue.Aesthetically it looks almost like the original Type Cover, but thicker. This adds a bit of bulk and thickness when you fold the keyboard in. Another downside is that the laptop doesn't automatically detect when the keyboard is folded, hence the screen is still switched on. I need to manually press the power button to get it to sleep.And regarding the lack of back lights, I personally find it to be a non-issue since there's always light from the laptop screen. The keyboard layout is largely similar to my original Type Cover so I don't have any problems finding the keys when typing.Verdict: I will choose the original Type Cover over this any day, but for its price and ease-of-use, I'd recommend it to anyone with a dead SP keyboard (until you need to replace your laptop)P.S.: I found out that my computer doesn't detect my original keyboard after it has its battery drained. It will automatically detect again once the battery is fully charged. Might be a bug, I don't know, but having Fintie's as my back-up keyboard doesn't hurt\n","id":"1a8e4eed-db8d-4cc4-a4cc-f4224cfd607c"},{"text":"\n  Take comments about the \"jumpy\" track pad seriously. There is no way to adjust the track pad sensitivity  e.g. turn off pinch zoom, because the  track pad not is not recgnized as such but is recognized as a \"mouse\" in Windows 10 and there is no senitivity setting - only management of the speed of the pointer. Slowing down the speed of the pointer helps  somewhat but doesn't stop he incessant zooming from 100% to 50% or 25 % or on and on.This keyboard is only functional with a  mouse attached. The track pad is functionally useless.Because of the ssue, it has taken me 10 times longer to write this review - I have had to resize the window at least 3 dozen times.  A shame because the keyboard is otherwise an economical alternative.I would not recommend this product.\n","id":"00c6ee44-d9b3-4764-9df2-3887e1e0545d"},{"text":"\n  I was looking for a longer apple watch charging cable and this was one of the few that I could find.

This charging cable overheats my watch every time. Long after charging, the watch was always warm. I'm not an expert but I think it's either the circuitry, or lack therefor of, or the quality of the components in the charging cable head. It's possibly not regulating the power coming in and continuing to charge even when the watch is at 100%. This is not good for the watch.

The pros are it's a great concept for charging multiple phones but it seems like the more phones the longer it takes to charge each phone. The unit does not take up a lot of space and it's easy to set up. The cons are it makes MY phone hot on the backside - I use a Note 8 and the Samsung charger I would use regularly is a \"stand up\" Qi charging device and it does not make my phone hot. Another issue is the plug is too short and it's the ONLY plug I can use for the charging plate. If I wanted to use my \"fast charging\" adapter plug I could not because it is not a USB type charging wire. This makes the charging longer to fully charge MY phone. I compared the charging time between these two devices and this pad takes about 15 minutes longer for a full charge. Overall, I like the idea of this multiple charging device and the fact that you can just lay your phone down and charge.\n","id":"6ba1b0b7-8563-4d36-a773-3b0ec69ae4e4"},{"text":"\n  Although the idea of charging up to 3 wireless devices at the same time is intriguing; A discouraging issue I found when connecting this multi-device charging pad to power is the fact that it uses a proprietary AC adapter plug (not a USB type cable/plug). In addition, the cable is relatively short which severely limits your options for placement of the unit.The charging pad supports wireless charging of all QI enabled devices. I have a Note 8 and my wife uses an iPhone X. Both devices charge normally when placed on the charging pad however please note that the charging pad is incapable of fast charging, even when a single device is charging. There’s also a noticeable charging speed decrease with each additional device placed on the charging pad. I noted a decrease in charging time of 10-15 minutes when charging 2 devices simultaneously.Despite the limitations I’ve listed above, this Multi-Wireless Charging Pad is still a very useful device. Especially when you’re not in a hurry to charge your devices (such as overnight). It also takes the place of 3 individual wireless chargers and the fact that it lays flat on a surface means it wastes much less space than individual charging units/stands.It’s a great concept with a mediocre implementation.\n","id":"d8035c84-1f8e-4925-bee8-f453a2507183"},{"text":"\n  So where do I begin?  It works effectively, and evenly charges all three devices when in use.  It's a three-device standard Qi charger that works for all of my Samsung qi-enabled devices without fail. The product is very simple with three wide area contacts and clear markings for where the devices need to be placed.  The faux leather wrap is somewhat asthetic, and doesn't overheat the product. The stitchings are a nice touch, and make it look a little more high end than it actually is.  By appearance, you paid a hefty price for it.  It will charge through some thicker cases.  I have a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle case on one of the S8 Actives (thicker model) and the Note 9 (thinner model), and neither case has imeded the charging time or response to the pad.  It gets warm to the touch after long periods of charging, but absolutely nothing to be worried about.However....It's slow to charge with one or with three devices, and it feels cheap. From a distance, it looks high end, as I said earlier, but once you get hands on, it feels like you could snap it in half if a toddler got hold of it. All of the contacts have their own fault-tolerant effective charging rate, or so it seems.  When charging a Note 9 and two S8 Actives (all with the same 4000mA battery), they charge evenly, but don't expect this to be something you're going to drop a device down and have charged up 50% in an hour. I've only managed to get a noticeable charge of 20% per hour regardless of the number of devices on the pad.If this is going to be something you'll be charging extra devices on overnight, then it's absolutely perfect.  If this is going to be something you expect to lay down your phone, do something quick, and hope to come back to a 30%+ increase, then whatever \"quick\" task you plan to do should probably be no less than an hour or two in length.\n","id":"1cccb0f8-2c41-4a0b-bd65-f9b4929f7596"},{"text":"\n  ALERT: Inside the box was a card offering me $10 to leave a 5 star review.

It is very thin, so I can comfortably use my phone while sort of holding it with my hands while it's on the stand. I also like that the phone sits very low to the desk and isn't raised up much, which makes it harder to use while resting my hands on the desk. And the angle is just right.I saw a few old reviews (on the regular product listing instead of the 2 pack) saying this stand gets really hot while charging, and at least one person even reported a small fire. The base does get pretty warm, but I'd have a hard time believing this could start a fire, so that person must have gotten a defective one.I actually have an older one that looks very similar to this, but not quite exactly. I believe this one I just bought must be an upgraded version of the one I already had. The new one has a slightly thicker base, doesn't have a wireless charging symbol above the words \"FAST CHARGE\" on the vertical part, and the light works a little differently, but otherwise they are pretty much the same and both. They have another model that looks entirely different, but both of mine are extremely similar. I don't see a model number but I guess it doesn't matter. The point is, the new ones are a little better in my opinion, and I'll explain why.Here's how the light works on this new one. When the phone is not in the stand, the light is off. When the phone is charging, the light is green. When the phone is done charging, even while still on the stand, the light turns off again. The light is also fairly dim. Personally I'm not bothered by lights like this when sleeping, but it's a common complaint on these kind of chargers that the lights are too bright, and it seems they addressed that by making this one dim.In comparison, my older version of this charger has a brighter light (which may annoy some people), and it is blue when the phone is not charging and green when it is. I always found the blue and green confused especially since I've had other chargers that are the opposite, so I actually like that the new one only has a light when charging and nothing else.I bought a few of these to replace my Anker ones. The Anker ones were just okay, and I had the 5 watt version, not the 10 watt one, so it's not a perfect comparison, and they may have made improvements in that one. but the one thing that frequently annoyed me about the Anker ones is sometimes I would set my phone on it and come back later only to realize the light was flashing, indicating it couldn't charge, and I'd have to take my phone off and put it back on to reset it. I never seem to have that problem with the Seneo ones.\n","id":"74d060ad-14b4-4508-9ffa-3671c06ca59b"},{"text":"\n  Bought 2 seperately some time ago. 1 just stopped working, that happens, so this week I bought this set of 2. 1st problem, they DO NOT charge the phone vertically, the originals did.

As I've previously had two of the older chargers from them, I was a bit sad that the older model was no longer available, but then quite happy to see that I could get a 2-pack for not much more than my original charger.  A plus of the new design is that they switched from Micro-USB to USB-C.  Sure, the cable comes with both the new and the old version, so it's not like it matters, but I do appreciate the move to most charging happening over USB-C.  Just means I can use either a USB-C charger or a regular USB charger for the charger.  On a downside, though I'm not taking stars off for it, the new model doesn't come with the 110v adapter.  Luckily, I have a dozen of those.  Even Apple got rid of their chargers, so that seems to be the direction everyone is going.Pros:- There are 2 of them!- USB-C or regular USB, so you have some flexibility on how you power the device- Works as expected- Landscape or horizontalMiddle/Cons:- Much more visible green led bar showing that your phone is charging. Great that it's more visible, less ideal at night if you don't like green light- Doesn't come with 110v/220v adapter, but nor do most USB devices in the past 6 months or so\n","id":"0f565a49-e23a-4f14-bcb9-61a8d33ed1f0"},{"text":"\n  I will not purchase another phone unless this works with it.

This way I can swap out the inductive charger if I need a faster charge with my QC3 charger.

It is easy to line up anywhere on the pad, and with my phone, it even charges when placed sideways so I can watch a video while charging. The rubber pad at the bottom keeps the phone from sliding off.All in all, a great charger that charges fast and is easy to use.\n","id":"d949d8a0-edaf-4407-90d3-c6dee8eb2ba4"},{"text":"\n  Given that I own an iPhone and an Apple Watch that I use on a daily basis, having a charger that charges both devices using the same USB port makes things neat and efficient.\n","id":"89a5ed1c-932a-4460-ab3c-e14e12a3ca13"},{"text":"\n  Its good for work and for bringing around as i do not need to pack 2 separate cables anymore and the cables are really flexible.\n","id":"3d2ebd68-ec99-4e1f-bf69-31c1f006e2df"},{"text":"\n  Purchased this specifically to have an extra watch charger for when I travel.

I'm starting this review this way because traveling forces you to be efficient and practical. The more moving parts you travel with, the more the possibility one, or all may be left behind. Yes. I have even left home without my bags. Because of lessons from the past, I now tend to want to group things into specific areas in the room in order to avoid leaving anything behind. This has been a challenge with the plethora of technologies I travel with. In the past, because of the endless variants of chargers, and cables I needed to a) charge my iphone, b) charge my ear buds, c) charge my smart watch, d) charge my ipad, e)my laptop, f) sonicare... etc. I've had to build a small bag with an endless collection of all possible chargers for all possible occasions and emergencies. Recently, I upgraded to an iphone 11 and my main concern was how can I find a WIRELESS charger that could charge the most amount of products in the least amount of space, using the least about of wires, and with the least amount of dollars. After searching on amazon, I finally decided upon Slicecharge. It seemed compact, simple, well designed, and most importantly easy to travel with. There were other variants from other companies that more or less had the same set up, but the movable iwatch charge port (you can angle it) was perfect for me because I have a watch band that is a loop which doesn't come undone. And this small circle solves the problem of the strap. Other things I like are the magnetized watch port (it secures the watch to insure charging) as well as uses a new technology called “Full-area Charging”. I'm going to travel tomorrow. I cannot wait to use it there. I'm sure I'll be at peace knowing that my technology is quickly and fully charged... and more importantly that no thing will be left behind.\n","id":"b2f76283-f215-457c-b6d0-ea746c60f180"},{"text":"\n  I ordered this to use flat and not with the stand part that I didn’t even open.

The white looks clean but knowing that oils, dirt and dust will transfer I knew it wouldn’t look good for long, so grey was my go to choice.As others mentioned, the base slips around as it’s plastic. An easy fix is to get some rubber feet dots and put them at the corners like my photo shows. The base now stays in place.After my first night of charging, neither my Apple Watch nor my iPhone 11 Pro Max we’re running hot which is great. You can place the phone where ever you want on the pad and it charges.

This is now my updated one. This worked great with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple Watch 4, and AirPods 2. I got an amazing deal on AirPods Pro so I decided to give my AirPods 2 away and upgrade. Well this thing will not charge my AirPods Pro at all. Not with all three devices on it not by themselves. I was really hoping this would since Qi standard is a thing, but it doesn’t. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE AIRPODS PRO. This is a great charger if you have AirPods 2 though. Time to find a new all in one charger.Right now I am giving it a 5 star review without having used it yet. The base of the charger is slick plastic and unless you use the stand, it will probably not stay in one place. Luckily all you need is an exacto-knife and you can change this. On the bottom of the included stand is a piece of black rubber with a sticky back. It is only attached to do thin pieces of plastic in a crossing pattern. Very easy to peel off. Still extremely adhesive. Just pop that bad boi on the bottom of the charger. Note. You need to have the watch part raised before doing this. Then just cut out the hole carefully so you don’t hit the wire for the watch charger. Obviously this makes the stand unusable because it blocks the stand’s attachment points with the charger, but you wouldn’t be doing this if you were gonna use the stand. Attached is my pics of it.\n","id":"98c6a90f-faa9-4fba-a013-5d0fdb9fd1f8"},{"text":"\n  I have both an iPhone and watch.I used around flat induction charger for the phone and apple charger on a stalk for the watch.The induction charger for the phone,being flat,made it impossible see the phone when used as a bedside charger and the phone had to be placed just so to attach.The watch frequently failed to attach and it was difficult to tell when either one was actually attached to its charger.This hard Cider Labs charger solved both problem with the Stand.It attaches instantly to both devices and its vertical orientation makes the phone easily accessible without picking it up.it is certainly an expensive option but well worth it for reliable and effortless charging.I liked it so much I bought a second one for my new residence.\n","id":"ebfbbb7c-fa65-4842-b064-af78b45cf935"},{"text":"\n  Everything about this charger is great, in theory.

The bamboo charging stand I had with the old phone had a lip that got in the way of the up swipe and send button on the new phone. The product arrived on time and in good shape.Some specs: It says the output (charging) is 5-7.5-10W which I think is dependent on the phone/device, which appears to be selected automatically as there are no buttons or anything to select. The charger is made of a sturdy matte black (i.e. not shiny/glossy) plastic. Vertical height is ~4-1/2\", the footprint is 3-1/2\" diameter round. The bottom has a ~1/4 wide circular rubbery ring to prevent slipping on smooth surfaces; this can be cleaned if it gets slippery (for me dust and cat hair). The ring is fairly impervious to liquids in that in a brief experiment, I wetted the ring, which resisted soaking up the liquid, and did not leave a stain on a white paper napkin. Overall weight is 5.2 oz so with the shape and good sturdiness- in mind, can be carried probably safely around on your backpack/bag. The back is held on with 5 metal screws, to get to the charging electronics, I guess. Overall, high quality manufacture and materials.Some more specs: The backboard that the phone rests against is 2-3/4\" wide and 4-1/2\" long (height) and is at ~θ =arctan (ΔY/ΔX) =60.945395900923° degree angle, which is a good recline to see the phone without alot of reflection and preventing falling forward. The phone rests stably on the backboard. For perspective the iPhone XR Max is 3-1/4\" W and 6-1/4\" H, 2\" longer, but rests stably, even at a wt of 9.1 oz in the case. The platform that the bottom of the phone rests on is ~2-1/2\" W with the bottom being the same rubbery material as the bottom base. Between the angle, the rubber, and the width of the platform,  the phone rests stably, however there is no lip to secure the phone in, but then you can swipe up to unlock the phone and get to all the buttons/icons. There are chargers that have cooling as a part of the charger, but I haven't noticed any heat buildup. I haven't clocked the charge time, but it seems as fast as my other charger.The charging cord is a mini-USB (see pic) which I think the same as the Sansung (?) and is 3-ft in length, so if you need a longer cord, easy to find. It does not come with an AC adapter block to plug into a wall outlet. I am guessing the standard iPhone charging cube would work as it is 5v 1A and the typical USB port on a computer is for the USB 1.0 and 2.0 specs, a standard downstream port is capable of delivering up to 500mA (0.5A); with USB 3.0, it moves up to 900mA (0.9A). I am using the 5v-1A port on my wood stand for power to the charger. If you believe the battery on the phone should work in the 20-80% charged range for longevity and allow discharging, the cord is easy removed, it attaches in the back into the base.Two chargers are good. I keep one on the home office desk (I work @ home) and plan to put one in the bedroom. For the bedroom one spec is that when you first put the phone on the stand a green ring lights up and turns of in about 5 seconds, just to let you know contact has been made; no flashing or continuous lights all night  :-)If you found the measurements, details and experiments helpful, please hit the \"helpful\" button, it provides motivation to do the experiments and provide unbiased data for a great community to see.\n","id":"3e0280e0-30ae-49f5-af73-7215d7d651e9"},{"text":"\n  I bought this one and their flat version. This one was meant to use while at work. I wanted something to keep my phone charged while I played a movie or show in the background. It is great at charging my phone (iPhone XS Max).The only flaw is that if I lay my phone sideways to watch a movie, it will not charge the phone. I tried it on two separate chargers (I bought one for myself and one for a family member). Tried it with the case on and off. No dice. I did fine a work around though. If I place a pad of small sticky notes on the charger, and place my phone on top of the sticky notes, it will charge while sideways.I think it might be a production flaw as the diagrams show two charging coils on the unit. I played around with placing the phone on different parts of the charger and it only charges while the top part is connected to the phone. I think the bottom one is defective.That is the only issue preventing me from rating this five stars.

The fast charging works flawlessly and doesn't get overly hot while doing so, especially compared to other wireless charging pads/docks.

It lights up for about 10 seconds after you put your phone on, which if you put it on right before bed, like I do, can be pretty annoying to have bright green LEDs in your face late in the evening.

Why can't I get a fast charge from this wireless charger?? The inclusion of a micro-USB is outdated now. Micro-USB can't keep up with these massive 3500-4000 even to 50000 mAH batteries that we see now. USB-C offers much higher energy transfer than micro-USB.

It let us plug in and charge two cell phones and camera batteries while running a dash cam out of the single cig lighter in the dashboard.  Having the voltage display was a nice confirmation that the adapter was plugged in and getting power.  The USB ports are 2.4amps so cell phones will charge quickly.  There's a small rubber ring on the end of the plug to keep the plug from vibrating out of the cig lighter - this works well.  Only change I'd make is including covers for the unused cig lighter sockets - it keep dirt out and prevent you from accidentally dropping something down into the socket and causing a short. I used old wine bottle corks for this purpose, worked great...and the wine wasn't bad either!  This device never let us down on 1000's of miles of wash-boarded, dusty dirt roads.

The sound quality is good, but probably best suited for podcasts as it does not have that bass punch that makes music listening enjoyable for me. The rubber tips on each earbud do help with some noise cancellation to an extent, and also make the earbuds much more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time than the traditional all plastic earbuds.

Anything at or over 10W (5V, 2A) should work fine. Works with thin cases. Looks best with lights off, but still looks good in light.I was honestly expecting the wireless charger to charge suuuper slow (some claim it's slow enough for their phone to die while it's on the charging pad) and I had completely accepted that—expecting just to use it as an RGB mousepad. That's all I really wanted it for. So I initially just plugged it into one of my PC's USB ports just to power the lights. Out of curiosity, I set my phone on the wireless charging pad and—to my surprise—it started charging. Even just drawing power from my USB ports was able to charge maybe 1 or 2 percent over the course of ~5 minutes. So I decided to plug it into a fast charging power brick (like the description says... and like the tiny piece of paper it comes with says...) and it started charging my phone as fast as I would expect any other wireless charger to charge. I specifically used my old Google Pixel XL's power brick (5V, 3A ≈ 15W) paired with a USB-C male to USB-A female adapter (the cable that comes with the mousepad is microusb to standard USB-A). I set my phone on the charger while I played a bit of Dying Light and over the course of maybe 20 minutes, it had charged my phone at least 10% (at which point it became full). The wireless charging pad also has an indicator: blue for \"not charging\", red for \"currently charging\", and green for \"done charging, but the phone is still there\". I'm not sure exactly how fast it charged, but I remember feeling like I had just set my phone on it at ~90% and I didn't even finish half a side quest before seeing the indicator turn green. I also used a Spigen Liquid Air Armor case (which is pretty thin) and it worked just fine.As for the RGB lighting. It's not bad. Pretty bright. Brighter than I expected. Looks amazing with the lights off, but still looks impressive with the lights on. Wish there was a bit more customizability, but that's kind of hard to implement when your only interface is a single button to swap through modes. The band that wraps around it to give it that illuminated color is fastened to the rest of the mousepad with what appears to be some type of nylon wire. I can't comment on the durability of this (because I got it yesterday), but this does make me question how long it will stay on. It appears to be threaded pretty tight together (each loop is only about a millimeter away from another), but I'd imagine that if one loop broke, it would all wind out like a stray thread pulls out of a sweater.Side note: my images make it look not very flat, but I didn't use the 3M adhesive strips they included in the box. Not sure if they'd help or not, I just quite frankly didn't care.\n","id":"9c6cff08-192e-4ca8-a1c0-4a483b003368"},{"text":"\n  A big upgrade from my old mouse pad, a lot smoother and just the right size to fit my desk.

There needs to be a way to turn off the blue charging light and dim the display even further. I know I can set the display to turn off but it would be nice to have the clock face showing at all times.Update: After seeing that I wasn't completely satisfied, Anker reached out to me to find out what they could do to improve the product. I told them it was too bright and they immediately began working on fixing that problem. Today I received not one but TWO replacements. The brightness is now 100% fixed and I couldn't be happier with the product. Anker continues to show that they have the best customer service in the business and I will continue to buy their products.Update: I've been using this product for a while now and am happy to report that there are no problems whatsoever!

I too, am hoping Anker will release a firmware update that will resolve these issues.For now, I covered up the blue charging light by placing black electrical tape on the grill. I also placed tape over the flashing colon, then hastily cut a piece of paper to cover the whole grill to reduce the dimness enough for sleeping.(Yes I know how sloppy the cutting is, I hope someone comes up with a template or something.Otherwise I do love this clock.\n","id":"6866502e-2dba-439f-8bdd-43a830c4e584"},{"text":"\n  In it's darkest setting the clock lights up the room.  What's worse, any of the indicators such as Bluetooth do too, so even if you have the clock timeout and go blank it's still a lot light pollution.

I had to buy light dimming decals to knock this thing down to tolerable levels and shut my clock off after a minute to be able to sleep near it.  Seems counter-intuitive to have to do that.Speaker is nice quality.  Operation is a little unusual.  Plan on downloading yet another proprietary app to set things like alarms.  You also have to be connected to via Bluetooth Phone/Media audio to use it so plan on your calls being hijacked if you're with your phone in the next room.Wireless charging, part of what lured me in, works but my phone is so hot in the morning I fear it might be doing some damage.

Brightness got a little better after the 0.6 firmware update, but still too bright.  I still find myself wishing Anker had opted for red or green LEDs like older plain alarm clocks tend to use.  I know I could turn off the display, but I like being able to look at it in the middle of the night when I pop awake sometimes.Despite that, I do manage to sleep just fine.  I just think it's a minor design/engineering fail.I also sometimes have to deal with annoyance of the Wakey deciding it needs to flash \"No Alarm\" or something like that for no reason I can figure out.Looking forward to further firmware updates.[Original review follows]This is really a 3.5 star rating rounded up because we can't do half stars here, I don't think.I've only had it for one night so far, and it works as advertised, which is a major plus.  This is not my first Qi-equipped alarm clock - if this one has better longevity that my previous ones, I'll be very happy.  It's an Anker product, so I have hope.  Especially for a product costing $100.I agree with other reviewers about the brightness of the blue wireless charging led and the clock numbers.  It would be nice to be able to change the blue to red (figure that's not possible) or disable it completely (future firmware RFE).  It would also be nice to make the clock numbers dim more at night.  It didn't really bother me last night, but compared to my wife's \"regular\" alarm clock with green numbers, it's *really* bright.  I don't know why companies think white is a good color for alarm clock numbers.  All of that is one star off.I also would deduct a half star for having to set the time via a bluetooth-connected app on my phone/tablet.  That's just silly IMO.I do very much like that I can plug my other Qi charging stand for my phone into the Wakey (I charge my tablet on the Wakey) and cut down on the things plugged into the power strip.

I dont think I got it fully charged in one day at all on my 14 day camping trip and I was leaving it from morning to dusk in full sun.I guess I can see some nice uses for it but I needed it for a CPAP machine so I was pretty disappointed as it ruined my sleep most nights.\n","id":"de52dc56-6685-4f57-a11f-3a9fabb68b18"},{"text":"\n  The Solar panel is a great compliment to the AimTom Raptor portable power station. You can use it to power/charge usb devices directly, laptops, and use it to charge up a power station.The 60w solar panel feels very well built and the panels themselves can take some abuse,I have personally tossed them around to test their durability.As for the effectivness of the panels to charge my 540wh power station, the best I have seen in an 8 hour period is about 35% charge of the Power station. Which in my opinion is very good for the size. The effectivness of solar panels depends alot on the angle of the panels toward the sun, so that may have had an effect on my test.Overall highly recommended!\n","id":"62fc9a00-03c2-4101-96da-7fabf7b6455f"},{"text":"\n  The build quality is great, made of durable panels connected to a folding tough fabric in olive green and orange. Since it's going to be in the sun for long periods of time, I brushed on a coating of 303 UV protectant with a soft brush, to help preserve the fabric from UV damage. I will re-apply this every few hundreds hours of sun exposure to keep it it protected. It hasn't had any effect on the solar performance, even though the coating was also applied to the panels themselves. This is because solar panels use very little UV light and are mostly using the visible light spectrum to generate power.I connect this to an Energizer PPS240W01 portable power station and they work perfectly together, fully charging the 240Wh power station with about 8 hours of sunlight.\n","id":"b6889156-11eb-4d14-bd5d-fb291b2d701a"},{"text":"\n  Used to solar recharge Aimtom battery.

She works with  alot of people, but her specialties are 40 & above. It is not so much the money for her, but that she CARES & skin talks to her, as she can read skin. I have had some needling done with her & set up with some great face creams/serums.  I took this PEN in to her so she could look at it and explain to me how to use this. She Loved this Pen. However, she did explain to me the HOW to us it & HOW often, WHY & WHAT happens to our skin by using this procedure, in medical terms.  Due to the fact that we are killing the skin..sort of speaking... the skin needs at least 4-6 weeks to do its Healing & Turnover. Of course first we numb it then add the serum. She also told me to run it up & down in areas first all over the face, then reapply the hyaluronic & go back & fourth. Then I must WAIT 4 WEEKS (because I had been doing this already) before using again. I like the pen. It has 3 battery's that you can charge, so you have them set up. It can be plug into the wall socket too. Very nice put together pen and I think it is going to hit out here soon for being one of the best pens around. I would like to share some settings with you that I got from my professional skin dr.(esthetician). She said keep the speed between 1-3 right now. Speed shows in the small window on pen.FOR SETTINGS...Forehead-(.25-.5)  Under Eye-(.25)  Cheekbone-(.25/.5)  Upper Lip-(.25/.5)  Crows feet- (.5)  Cheek-(.75/1.0)  Nose(.25)  Chin-(.5). 2 passes once up&down & once back & fourth, applying new serum between each go. Wait 4-6weeks depending on your type of skin too. Some of these settings can be adjusted in time. I sure hope this helps someone out here in cyber space. This is the info I was looking for. Be Safe, micro-needling tooo much can cause the skin to harden because of damage done by overuse, before giving your skin time to heal.Hope this info helps!\n","id":"5d73b081-aed5-4f38-b4a3-5c132d3c4ce9"},{"text":"\n  It's very good if you have knowledge of how to use. But if you want to know how to use, you should read information about machine and cartridge (because it's important for type to skin). If you want better results use retinol (vitamin A), vitamin C, acid hyaluronic, or other substances that can be harmful to your body (I recommend use together). After de treatment of microneedling use oil for your skin and drink a lot of water. It's important to know that you can't be exposed to the sum, because you can damage your skin.

Even basic recipes I manage to ruin the meat.  So I gave up and ate out almost every meal.  This was unhealthy and I gained a LOT! of weight and have high blood pressure.  When I saw the original Meater, I was intrigued with the idea of something automating cooking steaks in particular.  I bought the original Meater about 5 months ago and it really did change my life.  I still eat out, but only 2-3 times per week.  I have lost weight, have more energy, and blood pressure went down.  All in 5 months.  Even if you don't buy a Meater, just stop eating out and it helps.A few days ago, I saw this new Meater+ that now has a built in extender in the charger.  I received it 2 days ago and have made Ribeye and Tri-tip already.  It works great.With Meater (original one) I used an old iPhone next to Weber BBQ that would connect probe to Wifi.  Then I used my iPhone to connect to probe anyway in the house.  I have an access point in my house and could stay connected down the street.  With Meater+, no iPad is needed now.  The wood charger now extends the Bluetooth signal from probe.  How it works is you just leave the charger next to BBQ and it extends the signal really far.  I didn't measure the exact distance but my BBQ is in the back yard and my office is on the other side of the house upstairs.  Connected perfectly and I answered emails while my steak was cooking.  When alarm went off, I went back downstairs and had a perfect ribeye!  Even tells you how long to let it sit before you cut it up.Couple tips-  I updated the original Meater app on my iPhone and make sure you do the initial charge for 4 hours.  I was so anxious that I tried connecting probe to iPhone out of box and it wouldn't connect.  I thought it was defective.

I did move the  bottom bracket all the way down per the instructions.Placed the phone on the charger and went for a ride.I did notice the fast wireless charging message on the screen, so so far so good, but a few minutes after I noticed the wireless charging beep/message pop up on the screen again. It was still charging.. Few minutes later, same thing. This behavior repeated many times.So I did an experiment.I removed the case from the phone and placed it on the charger. Now it was going a longer time before the charging message would pop up.Lastly, i removed the bottom bracket of the charger, placed the case on the phone and put the phone just a tad lower on the charger than the bottom  bracket would have allow. To give you an idea, the left pad of the charger, was pressing half of the bixby button (i have bixby deactivated)I found that this position, the wireless charging would activate and work flawlessly for a very long time.Is possible that due to the size of the note 8, plus putting a case that would slightly move the phone higher (due to the bottom bumper of the case) and put it right at the edge of the coils, which made the charger go in and out.It is unfortunate that Iottie did not include a longer bottom bracket to allow the Note 8 to match with the charging coils.I cannot use the phone without a case and not using the bottom bracket and trying to align the phone each time is a huge hassle, so I will continue to use it like it is now  and ignore the charging beeps that come on frequently.\n","id":"37b01c47-a45d-4e1a-b3cc-870f4cb1ae0e"},{"text":"\n  POSITION PROPERLY - Awesome Works perfectly- but just a heads up for iPhone 8, 8 plus and iPhone X users if you don’t position the mount properly your phone will show charging but it will discharge slowly- to avoid this position so the apple logo is visible above the mount from the back, adjust the legs or the base accordingly so you don’t have to do it more than once.

That's not the worst, and yes you're only paying ~35-40 bucks for this product.Headphone stand also just works, it's not fantastic or anything but who needs a premium stand? If I can hang my headphones on it then it has fulfilled it's duty.Overall I would say this is a good product for the price I paid. Solid, would recommend for anyone looking for a small headphone stand that also wants to charge multiple devices.\n","id":"3c553858-f802-407a-b6c2-66e55a1f8f4e"},{"text":"\n  There is a slight high pitch cycling noise from the internal transformer. If you don't have the best hearing or work in a noisier environment then you won't even notice.The USB ports charge quickly and the voltage seems clean/where it should be. Tested with a volt meter. The induction charge pad is a bit slow for larger phones, but would be fine for small/mid sized phones. The power cord is a good length and quality.The hanger is nice, but makes the unit easy to pull over as there is not enough ballast in the unit. If there were more ballast then the whole unit wouldn't slide around a desk as easily.\n","id":"ea7c2971-7e8b-4516-9045-75ce6efa08e9"},{"text":"\n  I like this headphone stand a lot its sturdy and looks nice. The USB outputs work really well and they are a nice addition to the headphone stand because it makes charging your headphones much easier. The only problem I had with the stand is when trying to use wireless phone charging. The wireless charging area is too small so you have to slide the phone a long time around the stand until you find the correct area where it starts charging the phone. It gets really annoying and some time takes a few minutes to find the correct spot however once you do find the correct spot, it does charge the phone without any problems.\n","id":"0c1b952a-d221-4de2-b6cd-f4876eba0d40"},{"text":"\n  Bought this with high hopes. It fit my head well and is sturdy. Used the surface charger with my Samsung S8 phone to recharge at night. 1st headphone stand worked for about 3 days with my phone surface charger when stopped working. Returned it for a 2nd one which last a few more days then the 1st but again the surface charger stopped working again.\n","id":"5fc226b2-fb78-41d7-9a2b-79c603ec5596"},{"text":"\n  Upon speedy delivery I was excited to test out the stand. Packaging and assembly was simple. Plug the power cable to the base, slide the stand to the base and press the power button. You really can't ask for anything simpler.My only issue was the (metal) stand was pushed in a bit making it impossible to slide in unless I pry it open a bit more to push into the base. Other than that its sturdy. Base is just heavy enough for some lightweight headphones but I'm sure it'll work fine for heavier ones as well.The stand is pretty low and doesn't topple easy, a light topple test just made the unit wiggle a bit so I consider that passable for me as it will primarily never be moved or touched in my room.Love the wireless charging base and the extra 3 USB ports for charging as well, I can charge my phone, wireless earphones, and my wireless headphones all in one unit with an extra port to spare. It's a great little all-in-one and I'm very pleased with my purchase. Registering the device get's you a LIFETIME warranty which, to be honest, I was very surprised about and happy to know.\n","id":"6e8231d4-f60f-47ed-97bd-86fc1b6a4f96"},{"text":"\n  Have been using this for a couple of months in a small church. This charger is larger than I thought and very well built. It has been very reliable and has yet to fail me.Only giving it 4 stars becuase it is a very expensive product given its function. Otherwise a 5 star product.\n","id":"7c09159d-0ee0-437c-9bcb-f7f9e4f08279"},{"text":"\n  This unit allows for one to have 2 batteries ready to work.
