[{"text":"\n  Honestly, the laptop is great! I did buy a 1x8GB kit of ddr4 sodimm 2400mhz cl16 ram to upgrade the memory on the laptop from the original 8GB, and I made a quick discovery that the laptop comes with 4GB of RAM soldered onto the motherboard, thus you can only replace the other stick of RAM in the populated RAM slot that has a 4GB stick in it. So I now have 12GB of RAM on my f512d ryzen model. Furthermore, the SSD that came included with my model used a Kingston 256GB SSD, leaving one open slot for a 2.5 inch Sata SSD or HDD. The battery life lasts about 2-3 hours on a near-full charge, and since my college classes require atleast a 1.5 hours of charge per class, I could dim down the display for less battery usage and possibly the keyboard backlights, but I'd say it's a win either way. Overall, the screen is IPS and beautiful, the entire system  feels snappy and responsive, and I can actually run 3D applications on it without it bugging out like my last Samsung i3 laptop from 2013. Love AMD's new product lineup and I hope this helps anyone else looking to buy this laptop.UPDATE:Sadly, my unit didn't last long. I just began using my 3-d softwares and new code IDE's for C++ and this thing blue-screened every 5 minutes or so. Sometimes I was lucky and it'd work nicely but just today, the drive slowed down to a near halt and as windows tried to repair or reset it, it just died. I now boot into the bios everytime with no storage or boot-detection of the ssd. What a brilliant time for it to die. Also for battery life, turning off the keyboard backlighting litterally gave me 9+ hours of battery-life. Sad to see it go.UPDATE #2:Please check comments to this review for more. With all due respect, I won't be updating anything in this review or responding to any of the comments published beyond this date. I hope I was able to help anyone with their purchase.\n","id":"eac4d04d-4bd9-4aa1-bf55-d6259d9bbdf1"},{"text":"\n  This product seemed like a bargain...(Ryzen 5 3500U, 8gb model)SUMMARY (2400mhz RAM only runs @800mhz off the charger AT ALL TIMES) (ONLY 1 RAM SLOT)DEEMED: DECEIVINGFirst things first...THE RAMAdvertised at 2400mhz: with descriptions, reviews, and answers that are misleading.  First thing to know: upon contacting ASUS, there are two possible motherboard configurations: one with 4gb of soldered RAM paired with a 4gb SODIMM, and a configuration with NO onboard RAM, and one 8gb SODIMM.  I bought an extra RAM stick hoping to boost up to 12 GB only to find out I had the MB configuration NOBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT.So you can imagine, as I’m about to add this sweet 8gb stick: there’s already just a single 8gb stick in the slot making the upgrade redundant.Next, I decided to install CPU-Z to see what the hold-up was.  I noticed the laptop was a bit slower than I expected for the specs when it wasn’t on the charger, and let’s be forward here the only reason anyone BUYS a laptop is to use in portable situations hence the expectation of full performance away from the plug.  Anyway, upon installing CPU-Z I noticed a few things off about the RAM.  First off, it ran at a native 1866mhz when plugged in UNTIL you do something that requires an extra push, at which time the RAM ramps up to the advertised 2400mhz.  Secondly, I checked with the cord unplugged to find out the RAM was running at an APPALLING 800mhz.  The ASUS spokesperson said that it was an expected feature and not a defect.What makes things worse: I know how RAM modules work.  A single SODIMM draws such a small amount of power, that revving it down to a speed equivalent to that of a mid-tier DDR2 module is unacceptable!  Just another factory implementation of a throttling method to force people who get their PC for a bargain to regret making the right decision.To make matters EVEN WORSE: this model comes equipped with a Ryzen 5 CPU.  *What’s wrong with that?*  What’s wrong with that is this: Ryzen CPU’s by design, are relatively dependent on the onboard RAM.  MEANING: Slower RAM = Worse CPU performance.So, RAM that performs at 1/3 of the advertised speed, (2400mhz is just OKAY for RAM in the first place) a single RAM slot with no option for dual channel, and a CPU that WILL perform slower as a result make this PC perform at the $150-$200 range when away from the charger.BUY SOMETHING ELSE FROM ANOTHER BRANDThe one plus= The nice screen-to-body ratio.\n","id":"d50aa4bc-0eff-46c6-ad36-b970475c8181"},{"text":"\n  The SSD and RAM  are upgradeable but it does not have any empty slots for anything.When opening the case there are no hidden screws.It has a single stick of DDR4 RAMIt uses a PCIe NVMe M.2 SSDPictured are the upgraded SSD and RAM\n","id":"6e051734-debf-4ea7-9376-afe8910efa0a"},{"text":"\n  Received this and after using it for 2 days, was overheating and had to turn on the very loud emergency fan, screen kept blinking black throughout use from day 1, websites like linkedIn were working soo slowly...Not sure what it was but had to return it and very unsatisfied with this.\n","id":"d23bf56f-87a7-4d33-bde0-fa3b13667101"},{"text":"\n  Good computer for the money. However l sent an email to ASUS asking about maximum upgrade for ram and if there was a spot for an added hard drive. I was told it could be upgraded to 12GB and there is a slot to install an additional 4GB. If l wanted a larger hard drive l would have to replace the one currently installed. As you can see by the photos there is no slot to add RAM but there is a space for an additional hard drive. Even looking up the specs yourself online you are given incorrect information. I had it delivered to the Philippines and am not going to pay to send it back. It is a good computer for the price, my real issue was with ASUS not even being able to provide accurate information to upgrade.

The keys feel textured and not smooth like some other laptops which, personally I prefer it.Review:This appears to be Lenovo's answer to the mid-grade $400-$600 laptop shortage. If I had to guess it seems like this is in the chaise of the S145 with a 3500u APU.Compared to my wife's Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-14API with the same processor, ram, and SSD - performance wise it matches, but that's not the end of it. Her computer has what feels to be an all metal design, the ability to flip into a tablet, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, and a much better IPS display (still 1920x1080) with better viewing angles. We purchased this for her last July, 2019 and the difference of final price was ~$75 higher. At the time of writing this the same laptop goes for $750 on Amazon for the \"New\" model and $699 for a used model.Conclusion:If you need a sub $500 laptop right now, this is a solid purchase as long as you know what you're getting. If on the other hand you have the luxury of waiting a few months I would wait.If the prices/stock stabilize you can get much more bang for your buck for nearly the same amount of money. More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it's suppose to come in at a similar price point. Even if they come at a higher price point it will drive the price of the 3500u down.\n","id":"8ce98b56-548c-4ec3-91dd-c272c03968dc"},{"text":"\n  The Lenovo Ideapad 3 14 laptop is a very solid laptop and a must-buy for just $450.To start off with the pros,This laptop is very light, portable, fast, and powerful. I'm a college student going into I.T. and I edit videos a lot. The RAM, GPU, and CPU can easily handle that type of workload for 1080p video. The Ryzen 5 3500U with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics is more than capable of handling light gaming, 1080p editing, Unity/Unreal/Blender rendering, and absolutely blazes through everyday tasks.The keyboard has a phenomenal feel to it. While it's definitely no Thinkpad keyboard, it feels much better than most laptop keyboards out there. The membranes give a nice, tactile, solid feel to each large key, providing a comfortable, solid, satisfying typing experience.The 256GB NVMe SSD gives the laptop a very snappy speed, with a near-instant boot time. While the storage capacity is definitely not vast, it makes up for it in speed. The Ideapad 3 also includes 2 USB 3.0 ports, so an external SSD/HDD is definitely a viable option if you want more storage on the laptop. (it's what I did.)The 1080p display is crisp, sharp , and beautiful (if you spend some time color adjusting the screen in the Radeon settings.) It's definitely more than viable for watching movies, streaming TV shows, or editing videos in 1080p.Now for the cons,The Ideapad 3's battery is definitely not a poor one, but it's far from great. On max performance mode, I rarely get more than 2 hours of battery life out of this computer on full brightness. However, running this on the \"better battery\" mode barely sacrifices any performance for me, and I've been able to get a significant 4-6 hours of battery life when running that mode.The trackpad is a very smooth experience, yet moving your finger around on it produces a weird knocking sound occasionally, but I've found this to quiet down as the laptop is used more often. Minor gripe.I know a lot of people have complained about the screen on this computer, but honestly, it's far from a bad display. Sure, it only goes up to 220 nits (from my testing) so it can't realistically be used outside on a sunny day, but for indoor use, even in a bright room, the display is easy to look at and is bright enough to be very clear. Now, keep in mind, the screen comes with all the downfalls of a TN panel, with viewing angles being rather lackluster, but while looking straight at the computer, there's few displays you can get that beats this one for a sub $500 laptop paired with this powerful hardware.In conclusion,If you're looking for a good laptop for under $500 that doesn't look or feel cheap despite the (very solid in my opinion) plastic construction, this Lenovo is an absolute no-brainer. The Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 provides performance akin to laptops over double this one's price. If portability, power, and convenience are what you're keeping an eye out for, I can easily highly recommend this computer.Qualifications:- Information Technology Major-Computer Repairman for 4 years (both desktop and laptop)-PC system builder-Overall Computer EnthusiastThanks for reading my review!\n","id":"ad0db856-a821-44bc-bbbd-cc4b3e043684"},{"text":"\n  U can't buy a jet? Don't worry. Buy this laptop.\n","id":"fc690b77-2380-4317-a241-507bf51fce86"},{"text":"\n  This is a very good laptop that is very capable of AAA gaming at high settings. It was packaged well with seals to prevent any kind of tampering during shipping. Included was a very basic, but free neoprene sleeve for the laptop. There are no straps or pouches but it is soft and will protect the laptop during travel better than if it were left exposed, but I would still suggest getting a carrying case or a backpack if you do plan on being portable with this. Also included was an HDD upgrade cable and screws in case you want to add a your own 2.5'' drive to the empty bay on the motherboard.The 1080p 3ms 144hz IPS display looks great and also has great viewing angles. If you've never used a 144hz Panel before, you can never go back to 60Ghz monitors for gaming again. 144Hz ruined my last gaming laptop because the difference is extremely noticeable (in general, it feels smoother when you move in games) compared to 60Hz panels. The webcam is passable at 720p. It's fine for chatting with friends or zoom meetings but not recommended for anything beyond that. It also cannot work with Windows Hello. The 10th gen Intel i7-10750H 6core 2.6Ghz base clock speed processor is very efficient, powerful, and has decent integrated graphics (which the laptop will prefer to use when you aren't playing games or doing any kind of intensive work that would require more GPU power). There's a lot of value in this laptop given that this CPU alone is sold for $400 and the laptop also has an RTX 2060 6GB. The RTX is the newest architecture that has the ability to do ray-tracing. If you don't know what that is, it's realistic lighting effects that developers are putting into games now, but you need a card that has the ability to process it or you can't take advantage of the feature.The RTX 2060 GPU is very capable. My average FPS with very high settings on Assassin's Creed Odyssey was 70. In GTA V on high settings, it was 115. Interestingly, this laptop has a button called Turbo. Now, there's no overt explanation for what it does when you take the laptop out of the box and don't read the manual, but it essentially overclocks the GPU for you and kicks the fans into hyper-drive to compensate for the extra heat involved with overclocking it. In terms of performance, on the two games I tested the FPS on, it gave me an average of a 10FPS increase. It is noisy though when the fans are on full blast. I have to give credit to the fans which Acer advertises as \"4th Gen AeroBlade™ 3D technology\" and the thermal management of this design because even when the CPU and GPU are being stressed, the laptop stays at a reasonable temperature, and by that I mean you can game with it on your laptop while sitting down without it becoming too uncomfortable. Aside from the Turbo button, there's also a Predator button on the keyboard. Pressing this opens an application that shows you the current temperatures of CPU/GPU and even ambient temperature inside the laptop itself overall. You can customize your lighting profile here, overclock your GPU with 3 speeds (normal, fast, extreme), and you can set your fan speeds to a custom setting or leave it on automatic. Because Acer has this application that controls these settings from OS, the UEFI BIOS is pretty sparse. You can't customize voltages or do any kind of manual overclocking, but since the application does all that for you, and many gamers don't overclock their system because they think it might be too complicated or risky, this makes it easy to do so with a simple click of the turbo button or drop down menus in the application. Speaking of the BIOS, you're going to want to go into it (spam F2 when the laptop is powering on), and disable the annoying POST sound. By default, when you turn the laptop on, it plays a sound file that sounds like a jet engine firing up for some reason. I turned it off because I found it incredibly annoying, but I'm thankful the option to do that existed in the BIOS. Other than that, there isn't a whole lot of customization to do in the BIOS. It also has WiFi 6! It comes with 16GB of RAM (two @ 8GB) but the DIMMS are user serviceable so you can put 32GB (two 16GB) if you wanted to with no issues.The OS comes per-configured somewhat, using performance metrics for the OS (such as not using the Aero theme). There is some bloatware which I recommend removing.In terms of build quality...this is where the laptop starts to show its low price point. The entire laptop is made out of plastic, and it flexes really easily, especially the panel. The plastic trackpad is just OK, it will function for web browsing and light tasks but it's not that responsive overall. The two small cutouts for the sound underneath the laptop is a really bad design flaw I wish more laptop manufacturers would get away from. Please just include top facing speakers. The speakers themselves are already not great, so when they're shooting downwards it makes it even harder to hear some games even when the volume in game is at 100 and the operating system volume is also at 100. For this reason, you'll want headphones to go along with the laptop.The ports available are:Left side--Kensington lock, RJ45 ethernet, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, 3.5mm audio jackRight side--Mini-displayport, HDMI, USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port (gen 2 adds charging capabilities even when the laptop is powered off), and USB-C using 3.2 Gen 2.Behind--Charging port. Kudos to Acer for putting the charging port in the center behind the laptop.Acer rates the battery as being up to 6 hours, but don't expect to do heavy gaming on this laptop while you aren't plugged in. I got about 2 with some minor downtime between games.One thing I want to talk about is the design of the laptop. It does look good, but I think Acer needs to think about the type of person buying this laptop. It's going to be mostly students who want a gaming laptop that they can also use to bring to class. I don't think that gaming laptops necessarily need to look like \"gaming laptops\". A more subtle design and the removal of any kind of LEDs on the exterior of the laptop would appeal to a much wider audience in my opinion.Overall, this laptop is an incredible deal. For what you pay, you're getting an incredible capable gaming laptop\n","id":"de5d89b2-8ef1-44c6-9c82-38c20012d891"},{"text":"\n  I bought this laptop as a last second mobile CAD workhorse (I'm an Engineering Technician). I did a TON of research on laptops close to the $1K mark that were also prime available on amazon. There are a few configurations of this laptop on Amazon, this being the entry level RTX version. So far, I've been blown away by the build quality and performance of this Helios 300. ACER has been my go-to for reliable computing for awhile now. Let's get to it:PROS:X2 M.2 slots for storage PLUS a SATA bay for even moreRGB zoned keyboard (and a great feeling one for gaming / everyday tasks)BIG vents on rear and sides, PLENTY of intake area on bottomThe thing just looks awesome, props to the design team for making a gaming laptop that looks professionalPredator sense UI is clean, loads quickly, and easy to useWith ray tracing on I saw around 60 fps on COD war zone with settings maxed.Not so much CONS:Fans get loud under load, but they react quickly and bring temps down FAST.

For $1,200 you’re getting a beautiful 144hz/3ms 1080p display that’s very crisp and looks great. The aesthetics remain similar to last year’a model with the exception of the back vents look way more aggressive, very nice looking. It has in take slits above the keyboard for increased cooling. The 10th gen intel and rocking a 2060 or 2070max q depending on your configuration. Well, let me get to the meaty parts. Easily upgradable, non soldered ram, dual channel, WiFi 6 non soldered, two nvme slots and one 2.5 SSD slot. The cooling is PHENOMENAL. I was going to repaste but I wanted to see how it performed with factory paste. Well, the highest it reached was 91c and dropped down to 88c immediately. It was averaging 80-88c while gaming for over an hour(far cry 5 max settings). I will repaste just because I like tinkering with my stuff, but the average user not need worry about this. The GPU stays even cooler. Those intake slits they added above the keyboard makes all the difference. Let’s see what else... the sound is good, typical laptop speakers, use a headphone. The material feels very nice. It does not feel like a “budget” gaming laptop at all. In a sea of overpriced gaming laptops with similar or higher price tags, this one is truly the winner. Also, I know ryzen is great, and you’ll read all about “8 cores vs 6 cores maaaaan!” I went through 3 ryzen laptops.

Also the 2nd M.2 slot does show up if you put a NVME in there (not sure about SATA m.2 as I didn’t have one to test). It is standard 80mm size, same as the main slot, and seems to have extra room above/below it so I believe something double sided would fit, as would something with a SMALL heatsink on top (like say the Adata Swordfish one).Screen:Most of the other gaming laptops in the $750-1100 range have dim ~250 nit screens with awful <50% color gamuts. This one, 300nit rated (~330 actual based on reviews) 144hz and 100% srgb. It is striking, you won’t find a screen like this in this price range elsewhere.Power:Then you have a 8c/16t 4800H processor, which netted just under 4700 on Cinebench R20 in Performance Mode. For reference, my desktop running a Ryzen 3700X 8c/16t scores between 4600 and 4800 depending on background software and performance settings.Memory:The ram is ideal, 3200mhz, 16gb, you don’t want any less because that’s the lower limit for gaming and productivity, and you don’t want any more because each 8gb is about 3watts of power consumption. Not sure if it supports 32gb, I can’t see 16gb being the limit but the Lenovo Support responders in Q&A here seem to think it is.Battery.:It would be nice if they had any prebuilt options with the 80wh version, but they don’t, and I took a star off for that. Most of us would gladly pay an extra $50+ for that option. And I don’t feel like waiting 5+ weeks (2 months? 3?) for a custom one just to get it. That being said, with proper settings this 60wh can be sufficient.*Quiet Mode (fn+q until power led turns blue)*Battery Save mode on (click on battery icon, slide all the way to left)*Hybrid Mode on (this is ESSENTIAL, it shuts off the dedicated graphics card when not needed)*In Advanced Power Settings, adjust all of the AMD, Wireless, etc settings to their most ‘battery saving’ optionDoing all that I’m getting over 5 hours browsing the internet, longer if I have the internet open and am mostly working in excel or word (ie: normal school work/reports for office/etc). For instance, editting this review in the Amazon window, 4.1 hours remaining w/ 55% (7.5 hours total est). 7-8 hours watching Youtube @720p in Edge. Brightness at whatever battery saver drops it to when it’s on high to begin with. I intend on trying to swap in an 80wh when the parts are available.Build quality:The fit/finish and overall feel of the unit hits above its price point. The keyboard is exceptional for productivity, aside from the slightly cramped numpad. The touchpad is responsive. The rear I/O ports are great for desktop duty. But lets be real, Lenovo doesn’t exactly have a great reputation when it comes to customer service and turnaround times for repairs. None of the laptop manufacturers do though really, save Apple. My last Lenovo, a Y700, lasted over 5 years. I figure, get it, do some stress testing on the processor/GPU (Cinebench, Furmark), watch some movies and do some white/black backgrounds to check for dead pixels, and cross your fingers. To extend warranty through them is $50/100/175 for 1/2/3 extra years respectively, I personally am planning at least the $50 for an extra year.Heat:There is one drawback, this thing gets hot. I was expecting better thermals as I tested out a Legion 5 with the 4600H + 1650ti combo a while back. I would say this one runs ~5c average hotter across the board, and will spike to 95-100C+ if you’re doing something intense like Cinebench or Flight Sim 2020. In Flight Sim, average CPU temps over a 20 min flight were ~76c, CPU Die avg was ~85C. Temps are lower playing less demanding games, and even normally demanding games like AC Origins CPU avg was low 70’s, so not terrible. I spent some time looking into this, and apparently these hopped up gaming laptops hitting 90-100C is ‘okay’, even if I don’t really like or trust it. Also, the only option I know of that actually runs cooler than this with similar hardware is the Omen 15 AMD, so if temps are a priority may want to check that platform out. The Asus Tuf’s are as hot if not hotter, and the Dell G5 SE is a small portable sun. However, you do get something for this heat, the aforementioned Cinebench scores blow the competition out of the water, I still can’t believe it’s on par with my desktop processor.Final Thoughts:This thing runs warm, looks good (if you like the aesthetic), has a phenomenal spec sheet for the price, and has best in class screen for a non special-order low-mid budget prebuilt. Would recommend, with the one slight caveat regarding heat.\n","id":"e5828c9b-b127-4014-9904-764a81f3ad6f"},{"text":"\n  Edit 1: I was so happy with this laptop and put an amazing review.

I suggest updating the Intel Wi-Fi driver as the download and upload speeds didn't meet my expectations.  I had to visit Intel's site to download the driver as the laptop stated I had the latest.  There is a problem with the camera and have submitted an e-ticket with Lenovo to provide a fix.  They are supposed to reply back within 24 hours, but I have yet to hear from them.  :-(  Otherwise, my experience with the laptop has been good.  Boot up is quick. The sound is really decent for a laptop.  As far as gaming, I have only played RBI Baseball 2020 and it looked really good with no lag.  The fans are fairly quiet as they don't drown out the speakers when running.  All programs have booted up quickly and so far I haven't had to reboot due to any program freezing.  All in all, I'm really satisfied.  I will revisit the review if any other problems arise.\n","id":"4ec9b187-a7ff-4175-aa14-a740c92823cd"},{"text":"\n  Pretty: NVDIA, also love the navy body with gold/copper accentSmart: i7, 512GB, 16GB, you name itTough: military gradePlus, this \"girlfriend\", although looked skinny (at first I though I bought the wrong size as it looked so small) have big display (guys... don't think of other.

The Zen will be used as my work computer in my home office. I haven't started to work from home yet so I can't comment on how it handles work tasks. So far it has been a great little laptop while doing typical web browsing, word processing. I installed bluestacks to see if it could handle some light gaming of my favorite cell phone games and it did well. However battery life is seriously compromised when doing so and it heat up quickly, the fans stayed on. In Zens defense, this is not a gaming laptop, and I am by no means a gamer. I just wanted to see if it was capable.I'm seeing 7-10 hours of battery life on average. Nothing close to the 14hrs that are advertised. The trackpad is slick and responsive. Way more to than the Vivo.The one thing I don't like is the right side shift key is super small. I end up hiting the enter key by accident. It's not a huge deal breaker to tick off a star, but annoying.Will update once the Zen gets some work hours under its belt. For now I am happy with this Prime Day purchase.Update 8/17/2019A couple or weeks of work under it's belt and the Zen performs well. Unfortunately, the small shift key and overall squished feeling keyboard led me to return it. I was constantly hitting the enter key in error and the arrow keys lost all functionality for me being crammed where they were.I went though two Zenbook 14\". The first was purchased through a 3rd party and was obviously an open box or refurb, despite not making that clear in their ad. Fingerprints all over the top of the case and it was missing the Ethernet adapter. I got the black screen of death while trying to update windows 10. I had it less than 8 hours and back into the box it went and returned. Pictures I added to this review are of the returned 14\" side by side with the 13\".I then purchased the Zen 14\" with screenpad and better graphics card....typing on it now...made sure not to purchase from 3rd party.  Third time is a charm ! It came brand new, no fingerprints with all accessories. It may only be nominally bigger but it's a world of difference to me. Difference in cost was $322.06. May not be worth it to some but it was to me. I am completely happy with my Zen 14. Don't think I'll really use the screenpad function but it looks cool.You won't be disappointed in the performance of the Zenbooks.

For more details just go to the Asus page or Youtube.Now, for the hard part. I am currently living in Mexico and this model won't be available here and that is why I decided to get this laptop from a third party seller (more $) trough Amazon (+ import fees $ + shipping cost $). I know there are probably cheaper ways to get this but I decided to go with Amazon convinced they will handle all the paperwork and the import process.Unfortunately I was wrong. For my particular case, Mexican government has a set of rules called NOMs (Mexican Official Norms), and those apply for any foreign product with a cost higher than &1,000.00 USD. There are several NOMs a product has to comply with and getting the certificates is a rather long process that involves sending the product to a specialized lab for testing and a really long time waiting on the federal agencies for any response. The NOMs are in place to ensure a foreign product can be used with out harm within Mexican territory.While I was researching all these \"fun\" rules and their applications, I got to realize that they are aimed to the big importing companies. The ones that get a foreign product to be sold in Mexico, and in my case I am just a final customer looking to buy an awesome laptop.In my opinion, getting this certificates is the job of the ones like Amazon or the third party seller I got the laptop from: Michael Electronics; since they are selling and importing this product to a foreign country.I went trough a rather worrisome process where my laptop got hold on customs office for over 10 days. During this time I was in constant communication with Amazon and Michael Electronics and although they were super polite, they were NOT helpful.In order to get my laptop released I had to obtain an especial letter from Mexican government to exempt 2 (of many) NOMs. Surprisingly, Mexican federal agencies where extremely helpful and they got me the letter in 5 business days. I then submitted the letter to the customs officials and finally got my laptop.In summary:I don't believe this laptop should be sold by Amazon without the required documentation, the risk of the product getting stalled in customs offices is very high and there is no warranty that Amazon will issue a full refund (according to the representatives I spoke with). I could complain about the NOMs but foreign country laws are way out of our control and then again this is WHY we use big selling companies like Amazon. I believe Michael Electronics shares responsibility too but I also believe this is WHY they choose to sell their products trough Amazon. According to Mexican government agencies Amazon has A LOT of issues related to Mexican NOMs so to them: PLEASE, it is not a new topic and I am NOT the only one.For everyone looking to import this awesome laptop from America beware of what happened to me.Best regards!\n","id":"c74136cb-6804-4457-a3da-cbf99ff107f9"},{"text":"\n  Tiene una buena batería, liviana, excelente para viajar, el sensor de huella táctil es práctico, en ciertas ocasiones hay que hacer un par de intentos para desbloquear.En video juegos corren he jugado en alta calidad de gráficos, solo que se torna un poco caliente el teclado.El procesador es rápido y sus respuestas de carga\n","id":"c428fac1-7164-4750-9b8f-b96c24814497"},{"text":"\n  I love that Asus fit the 2060 Max Q into this portable beast.

I decided to do some research and found this laptop. While I love this model of Asus Zenbook for many reasons, I would recommend going with a different model of the Zenbook. I'll go through my general pros and cons of this model of the computer and my recommendation. If you don't want to read my explanation, you can just see the aspect in all caps.PROS:BUILD QUALITY: the computer has an excellent build quality in terms of its all-aluminum body, and the keyboard has the perfect amount of travel, especially compared to the Yoga, which sacrificed the keyboard for thinness. The screen is excellent for a1080p, and the thin bezels are very lovely. The ergonomic lifting hinge is pretty nice though you don't notice it until you aren't typing on another laptop keyboard. The ScreenPad works well, but I have more to say in the cons. this is my first computer with the iris scanner, and it is the greatest thing!INTERFACE: it has Windows 10 64-bit; there isn't that much bloatware from Asus on the computer. The MyAsus app on the computer which can update the BIOS on the computer and have some nice customizations to the laptop. The app includes options like partially charging the battery if you're leaving the computer plugged in often to protect the battery life, fan function, screen color customizations, diagnostic checks, warranty info, and manuals for the laptop.INNER SPECS: While inner specs are subjective to use, this laptop specs are pretty good for a business laptop or for a college student who plays light games (that is me) should guarantee that this laptop will run reliably for a good while. There is a lot of hubbub around the Intel i7 10 gen with the clocking speeds, but the results are relatively similar to the older generations, and if its an issue, this laptop has options for other generations. This laptop also has the ultrabook (thin laptop) version of the i7 inside.BATTERY: the battery on this laptop holds out for a good while if you're writing a paper or watching youtube videos, and while the charger isn't USB C, it charges the laptop pretty dang fast.FREE CASE: this model also comes with a free case, which is great for protecting this laptop in bags. It's not a fancy case, but it does the job.CONS:SCREEENPAD: The ScreenPad is overrated. There I said it. Once the new toy factor wore off, I turned it off to save battery life. While it sounds like a cool idea in concept, it isn't that useful. Lucky for you, they have a model of this laptop without the ScreenPad and a regular trackpad. I haven't had any issues with the ScreenPad; it just isn't justifiable for paying more.KEYBOARD: while the keyboard feels great for long periods of writing, the only problem I have noticed is the slight slanting of the backspace key. Maybe it's just my typing; I don't know. luckily this computer comes with a 2-year warrantyFINGERPRINTS: this computer is a fingerprint magnet, which isn't the end of the world, but just so you know.Conclusion: Overall, as I had said before, I would highly recommend you get a model of the Asus Zenbook 13,14 or 15 in, just not this one specifically. Get a model that doesn't have the Screenpad. Don't make the same mistake I made in being enticed by the ScreenPad and save your hard-earned coin to purchase the 4-year warranty offer for this computer by amazon our through Asus on the MyAsus app.\n","id":"52661d79-7526-4fa2-9858-66d822325e5a"},{"text":"\n  I have been using this laptop for just over 30 days and here is my feedback:PRO's:GREAT battery life (12+ hours consistently in normal use with power bar at max)GREAT build qualityVERY thin and lightGREAT Price to Performance ratioHinge Lift on screen definitely improves coolingIt is a really premium looking laptop in person and definitely looks high end for the priceCON'sFan noise is a bit too much compared to a surface or xps 13 (there is a silent mode but drops boost clock to 2.8)No touch screen (if you are into that sort of thing, I am not personally)Boost clock is a bit low when on battery (3.9g) compared to chip performance (underclocked to save power)Screen does not go full 90 degrees open which I like for laying in bed or on the sofa (but it works just fine, I am just being picky because it is a review)User Case:I am a computer hardware enthusiast.  I much prefer desktop PC's to laptops so when I set out to purchase a laptop for myself I did quite a bit of research.  For me a laptop is not for gaming but for doing work, browsing the internet, watching video and updating social media.  I wanted a machine that was lightweight, powerful enough to open large excel spreadsheets, had enough memory to manage a massive outlook .dat file had a good screen for watching video and had great battery life so I did not need to carry a charger with me.  Also, I wanted a machine that would charge using USB-C vs a barrel plug and power brick.  I also wanted thunderbolt in order to doc into my station in my office (at some point when we ever go back).  I found all of these things in this machine for under 1k.I was fully expecting to pay 1700 or more to find a machine that I liked and I was very surprised to find an intel ice lake powered machine for this price point.  I was concerned that only having 8g of ram was going to be an issue as 16g would be what I consider minimum acceptable levels.  So far this has not been an problem, even on larger excel files but then bear in mind I do not have a bunch of apps installed on this machine, mostly just MS office and Minecraft (which the iris graphics runs just fine btw).  This machine performs great, runs everything I need it to and I feel I am getting a dell XPS build quality and user experience for a lot less money.  I like the larger XPS-ish track pad and the integrated num pad is also nice.  While you are not going to do any AAA gaming on this machine that is not what you buy a thin and light to do (or really any laptop at all regardless of the marketing).  All in all I would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking to buy a good performing thin and light laptop in 2020 even with the upcoming tiger lake releases.\n","id":"f98c8c81-0874-42fd-9a01-8dd2e44deb13"},{"text":"\n  Laptop is very fast and runs quiet.

It’s by far the the best overall built laptop on the market that has power, battery life, portability, and build quality. Hands down.That being said there was one big issue with my laptop once I started playing around with it. After driver and windows all got updated. I started noticing blue screens on startup. Only sometimes. And it wasn't the same blue screen, it would pop up 3 different ones at random sometimes.So I noticed the only thing not update to the newest version was my bios. Thankfully I’ve been building and working with computers for over a decade now and was familiar with doing this. Once done the problem still happened. So I ran out of logical options as I had no clue what to do with this brand new laptop. It worked perfectly after the blue screen went away and it restarted on its own. Like nothing ever happened.But I called asus and they had no idea either then recommended I reformat my brand new laptop I’ve had for 12 days. With regret I had no choice at this point. So I went through the process of wiping the current operating system and redoing everything from scratch. Windows updates, driver updates, installing all the asus apps that work amazing on this specific computer.Finally got it done. Guess what? No more blue screens. So moral of this story is I’m not sure what asus is shipping these laptops with software wise. But I had issues out of the box on mine and ended up having to wipe it all and reformat from scratch. Now for me this isn’t a big deal. But some that are less knowledgeable vs me will struggle massively with this issue. So if some of what I’ve said is confusing or your don’t understand, It’s not a set up and go type of experience I have had. But now it’s problem free and amazing as ever. I just wanted to share my experience and earn some people if your not tech savvy then you may be on the phone with asus for quite awhile having them teach you how to reformat over the phone or be forced to send it in for repairs and be without your new laptop for weeks. Also got this laptop for 1300$ R9 cpu and 2060 1tb ssd 16gb ram from a different well know. Retailer for electronics on sale at a steal!But my system may have Been a rare occurrence and I would still highly recommend this product. It’s truly remarkable how heavy duty this thing feels. And it’s now been problem free over a week so I’m happy to say all has been solved thanks to me.

The mouse works as advertised 90% of the time, silent clicking (great for use with a desk top mic), excellent sensitivity/ DPI control, colors, the works. Sadly this has some draw backs due to design flaws. First, there is no indication for when the internal battery will die, and when it does, the charging port is in the front of the mouse directly underneath the left mouse button. This causes the charging cord, that (I plug into a front USB port on my computer), to get caught while using the mouse. Second, due to the irreplaceable internal battery, it makes using the lights impractical due to the extra strain on the battery if accidentally left on. Other than that the mouse is a great device.***Unfortunately, after only 6 months of use, the mouse broke. The input from the mouse got stuck in a loop and forced the cursor to the right side of the screen and prevented it from moving.

It is not in any way shape or form BUT... it performed perfectly with the following applications(so far):Games - Battlefield 1, Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Witcher 3, Skyrim, SWTOR and Fallout 4.Programs - Excel, powerpoint, Word, Pro Tools HD, Reaper, Pro Presenter, Google Chrome, Internet \"Exploder\"(IE) and AutoCad.The unit runs great while plugged in to charge and solo.On a bare desktop, it lags a millisecond. On a fabric gaming mouse pad, it runs about the same. On my Razer Vespula dual sided mouse pad, it runs like a champ, no lag on the cursor. Lag also applies when you have it plugged in to charge only, there is almost no lag when not charging.DPI selection button is fast and accurate. Silent R/L click is very nice. Smooth reactions with all applications i've tried it on.The Design is futurist and i love how my daughter calls it \"daddy's decepticon mouse\".RBG lights cycle is pleasant and the color scheme is honestly refreshing.PROs - great response, pretty RGB colors, silent clicks, nifty design.CONs - Rechargeable battery looks like 100% inaccessible, lower DPI settings lag a hair with Pro Tools HD and AutoCAD.In summation, For 10% the cost of my MAMBA I am very happy with this budget random wireless gaming mouse. Ill probably get another one after putting in a few dozen more hours with the witcher 3 and Battlefield.\n","id":"8ffffeff-6e3c-467f-9155-7469457a0b6e"},{"text":"\n  I've had my setup going for a weeks now.

It was slightly wobbly until my husband slightly bent a leg and now its great. It is the perfect height for typing and slides right under the couch no problem so it is over my lap.

The white and chrome trays were at least 2 1/2 times the price of these tables. The white and chrome trays were excellent quality but proved to be quite useless for my needs because they were so short that my legs wouldn't fit underneath them. I wanted a table that would allow me to eat an occasional meal while watching a movie, or to type on my laptop while relaxing on the couch. Well, the Tangkula table does both of these things very well (in fact, I am writing this review with my computer sitting on top of one). I liked the Tangkula table so much that I bought four of them. We keep two in our office and two in our den. When we want to eat while watching a move, we move them all into our den. They can be used as end tables, coffee tables or extra serving tables when guests come over. They are extremely versatile, and are very light and easy to move around. The dark brown color goes with most decor, and although they are not as beautiful as the tables I got rid of, I love them because they are easy to move and actually work. They are also very affordable. Because they are light, you can't put too much weight to them (such as when my daughter tried to sit on one - that caused it to bend and I had to bend it back), but almost any normal use should be absolutely fine. They are also covered in thin wood laminate, which hasn't come off yet, but probably wouldn't hold up to a lot of abuse (like if you ate every meal at it, or spilled lots of liquids on it). Given the great price and simple design, I will probably resurface the laminate with handmade paper and a couple of clear coats of verithane when it wears out, and they should last a very long time that way. The photo I included allows you to see the relative height compared with a standard couch, as well as the nondescript appearance which doesn't detract from other decor.\n","id":"d1b83a31-8bfc-4ddb-8528-4034688a87dd"},{"text":"\n  I needed a small table like to fit into my small walk in closet that can hold my makeup products.

The insulated food pocket is good for taking snacks on the plane.I use two carabiners (undersized, not rated for climbing) to attach the backpack to the rollerboard (carry-on) handle. This gives a very weight-balanced, easy-rolling load for traversing airports, etc. as well as the ability to slip the backpack on when stairs are involved.I haven't used the included raincover, but I do like the ability to use the sidepockets for either waterbottles or readily accessed zipper-enclosed storage.I travel with this and a european sized rollerboard for week or less travel. Each will fit under the seat, though not together. In Europe I am sure they would make me check one. I would probably choose the rollerboard to check, because of the ease of access during travel.\n","id":"7c457451-bd8b-4b6c-91b1-87b5b8aec2f8"},{"text":"\n  Saw the Legend IQ in Best Buy and saw that Amazon had a lower price, so I ordered it on here. Needless to say, I'm disappointed, but for the most part, it's serviceable until I find something better.It's nothing like the model in the store. Just a few warnings. This model is supposed to be old. It's definitely not as good as the version I saw in Best Buy. Also, I'm a bit concerned at how old this model is, because whatever is supposed to be the cellphone holder does not hold any modern cellphone popularized after the Iphone came out. IT'S ACTUALLY MEANT FOR AN OLD SCHOOL IPOD! So it's basically useless. But I'm not a teenager that needs to always listen to music and there's bluetooth anyways, so it's not a problem. There's also no strap for your carryon like what was shown in Best Buy.The sunglass holders also will not hold a case of any size. Not happy about that either.The drink holders also don't have the webbing that the model in Best Buy has. Drinks I've tested with it seem to fit snugly, so I guess that's not an issue.Kind of disappointed with Amazon and their QC. People are getting all kinds of different models of the same bag on here and that's messed up. Some guy thinks he got the wrong bag when he actually got the one I expected from Best Buy! Come on now, what a joke.Definitely will reconsider buying from here in the future. Get rid of all these dodgy sellers and guarantee your own product is what you say it is or I'll go somewhere else.\n","id":"14adbeb5-f437-4b17-9f0a-19a2a3e9fcb6"},{"text":"\n  I bought this backpack for my mother in law so she could transport her work laptop to and from work easily.  She had a computer bag that slung over 1 shoulder and it wasn't for her.  It created more issues with her back.  This solved her problems as she could support the weight of the laptop evenly and allowed her to carry items in her hands easily as this bag doesn't slip off her shoulder like the other one did.  She also likes how small and light it is as she doesn't need additional weight when transporting items.  She showed off this bag at work to her coworkers and she had people asking her where she got the bag and a few bought the bag the same day.  It is a great deal for a basic laptop backpack.\n","id":"1b6c1167-0e3a-4392-b55f-2e9267cbabe2"},{"text":"\n  The good stuff:It folds into small package with carrying case e.g. its very portable.  Has grommets at all 4 corners which are important because since the panel folds you may need to temporary mount it for best sun exposure.  Comes with ways of powering a lot of devices including 12 V, car batteries, and more which could come in handy.  Customer service responded quickly to all questions (more below)The bad stuff:Customer service answers not always understandable. Between that and a poorly written manual it will be hard to figure out what some of the attachments/cables do unless you are electrically savvy.  I don’t own a Watt meter but figured this out using a Power Station.  The solar panel’s Watt output in ideal but real world conditions can only power about 65 watts from the AC output of the power station and keep the power station battery from dropping or going up in charge.  Since there is a power loss when converting the solar panels dc output to the AC output of the power station the actual wattage of the panel is higher than 65 watts, but I can’t say how much higher. Its not giving the full 100 watts in ideal but real world use conditions.  I am not electrically savvy, have seen wattage tests where framed permanent 100 Watt monnocrystalline panels output max 81 Watts in the same conditions noted here - given my lack of expertise in this area, to be fair, take this last point with a grain of salt.Stuff you need to know if you get one:The manual is not clear and does not address quite a few important points which are listed next.1. There is a red light and a green light on the gray controller box. The QA on Amazon lists the wrong answer as well even though it was written by their customer service.  The green light means there is sufficient charge output.  See below for a complete explanation*.2. To charge a car battery see attached picture which shows the correct set up.  Confirmed by customer service.3.  The adapters (manual refers to as “connector cables”) which connect to the end of the DC to DC 6.5 foot cable are in the other attached picture. There is no connector provided to charge a laptop with a USB C charging port.* When I asked TP solar customer service about the lights they responded that the green light on attached controller means its producing power, the sunlight is powerful enough for powering an appropriate device.  The red light will not charge a device.  I had the panel out at 8 am in less than ideal conditions and it did charge my Power Station battery slowly.  So in my experience it will charge in some less than ideal conditions if the light is red.If you found this useful click the helpful button, thank you!\n","id":"c7543ea1-a421-45b6-af29-b2efa810ac37"},{"text":"\n  I have a ton of rigid panels and few flexibles, even a couple folding panels in the lower wattage range.  This was my first larger folding panel purchase and I was feeling discouraged while shopping reading so many reviews of dismal output from many top brands.I've had this panel for a whopping 4 hours and just got it set up outside for a test.  The sun isn't perfectly overhead so these numbers may increase slightly, but I don't plan to angle it or anything - flat is better than anything I could rig up given the position of the sun right now.Immediately showed 74-75w being produced when connected to a Victron MPPT (see attached image).  I expected this number to fall as the panel heated up - it's 95* outside and it's laying on hot plywood with no airflow beneath the panels, or from anywhere - perfectly still wind-free day.So, 30 minutes later it's producing 72w.  The 2x100w series'd rigid panels on my truck are producing 143w right now and actually have good air flow.  So I'd say the output of this panel is a lot better than what I've read of Dokios and similar, producing 60w from a \"200w\" folding panel.It's heavy but that's okay, it rolls up tight and compact and feels more durable than my smaller folding panels.  The smaller ones I have can be flexed but these feel like unfolding a book of floor tile, so that's where the weight is coming from.  No other comments on durability though, too soon to tell.  Just feels like it'll last.  Unfolding it is straight forward, you just flip the 6 tiles open and then unfold the other 6 from on top of it.  I liked that because I could unfold without having the panel producing any voltage until I flipped the last fold over - one side covers the other until this point.  People who are familiar with throwing blankets over producing solar panels to halt current will understand and appreciate this.The flap that hangs off the side where the output box (or whatever you want to call it) is ok, I previously thought it was stupid when shopping.  Part of the flap has the output box and the other part is what wraps over the panels and velcros them shut when folded up.  I don't think you could use this panel hanging horizontally (landscape mode!) without that flap catching the wind and being obnoxious, and causing stress on the wires inside that lead to the flap.  But would be easy to hang vertically with the flap hanging down.If you review this item, try to observe the panel voltage and charge current going in to your battery.  That's useful info in a world of subpar folding panels that barely hit half their rated output.Oh yeah, wires.  Let's talk wires.  They're terribly thin on all the accessories.  I'm using a 10 amp 2.1x5.5mm jack as my solar inlet to my charge controller so I was able to use the included 2.1x5.5 extension cable.  The MC4 adapter and alligator clip adapter are both like 22 gauge.  It's very possible the 2.1x5.5mm extension cable is also high gauge.  I ordered a 16 gauge heavy duty 10ft 2.1x5.5 extension (but I'm realizing now I should have gotten a male to male - it hasn't arrived yet).  In any event, using as large of wire as possible from the panel's output box to your charge controller is always recommended to curb voltage drop.If you really want to give the panel the best shot at producing, get a 2.1x5.5mm male jack with screw terminals (they come in packs of 10) from Amazon and shove as large a wire as possible as you can in to them (12 gauge in my experience) and keep the wire as short as you can to reach where it needs to go.  This will allow more voltage to flow through the wire at greater lengths and in high temps.Ending review, this took me a while to type and its been at least another 30 minutes since I said it was producing 72w.  It's giving me 70w right now - barring a handful of days here in Colorado this is as hot as it's going to get.UPDATE after first trip: Took this to the mountains and laid it in the grass to charge up my LiFePO4 camper battery.  Had to use their included 2.1x5.5mm extension cable again as the heavy duty one I ordered hadn't arrived before I left town.  This was going in to a Victron 75/15 MPPT charge controller.  72*F ambient temps and mostly clear skies.  Didn't bother angling it, and the grass wasn't letting it lay perfectly flat either so it was a very slight bowl shape.  Was watching the charge controller over bluetooth and about an hour in to charging I hit 80w for a while... covered in bugs (adding new pic).  Would recommend.\n","id":"6b8869b4-3b06-464b-8985-67c84bb61e84"},{"text":"\n  I love the compact design and the sturdy material used.

If at least one (horizontal) side of the \"T\" bar would heave a \"sliding pipe insert\" (similar to a bathroom shower curtain bar) that could be moved in and out manually and secured with a screw or with an inner spring, disassembling would be easier by just loosening the screws instead of completely removing them (this way the \"O\" rings could stay attached to the plastic tray when travel).3.

It is THE bag.  I spent weeks researching, trying to find THE perfect bag... for everything.  What does the perfect bag for everything look like?  Everki Atlas.  Wow.Priority #1 - NEVER EVER BE FORCED TO CHECK MY BAG AT THE AIRPORTMy number-one concern was that I wanted to find a backpack that I would NEVER have to check at the airport.  I like to travel very light (one bag only!), and loathe ever having to check a bag (for example, on a crowded holiday flight I had to check my previous backpack even though it would fit in the overhead compartment space easily the plane was too full by the time it was my time to board).  Success with the Everki Atlas.  Even when I filled the backpack up, the backpack doesn't stretch too much and I have been able to shove it under all the airplane seats I've tried.Priority #2 - Secure laptop padding & TSA-approved design... Yup.  On the laptop padding:  the Everki Atlas is the only backpack I've owned where I truly felt like my laptop was safe and secure and not about to be damaged.  In almost every other bag, even with a laptop slot and a cover over my laptop, I was always worried.  Not so with the Everki.Priority #3 - Pockets.  Thankfully, there are plenty of organizational pockets with the Everki Atlas.  As a girl, I get frustrated at the lack of useful pockets in both women's clothing and bag options.  The Atlas has everything I'd ever want.Priority #4 - acceptable at work... This backpack is not something I would take to a nightclub (obviously), but anything work or travel-related for me and this is THE bag.  I don't find it to be overkill going in to work either - I like having plenty of space to put my lunch, a notebook, reading book, purse, extra sweater, etc.Other things that I love about Everki Atlas:~ The sunglasses pocket at the top - so glad that it exists and also glad that it's a soft shell so it doesn't take up extra space if not being used.~ The open pocket in the front - very handy when I just need to shove something in there quickly~ This is so comfortable!  It doesn't hurt my shoulders - I absolutely love how thick and padded the shoulder-straps are.~ Grateful for the extra tiny loop at the top (this allows me to hook it on the stall any bathroom door that has a small hook)~ The bag stands upright by itself so you don't need to lean it against anything.Suggested improvements for new model if Everki reads this:1) add two compression straps on the side - the bag is so well designed it doesn't \"need\" compression straps, but I like to use them walking around (especially at the airport) to loop my jacket off of one side (I solved this by attaching a carabiner-bungee cord to the small loop in the center and the top handle)2) a slightly bigger water-bottle side pocket, although I was able to make it work - that being said I really appreciate that those pockets zip all the way up.3)  include the rain-cover, that would have been a nice bonusExtra note on traveling as a \"one-bag-only\" traveler with the Everki Atlas:So, my biggest feat yet as a \"one-bag-only\" traveler was being able to do a 3-week trip in China - in the middle of winter! - with just this one bag (as a girl!).  NOT because the bag is hugely oversized - it's not oversized, just well designed.  I was able to fit 3 small packing-cubes of (winter) clothes (not overstuffed), plus toiletries, plus two books, sunglasses, travel purse, and my laptop, tablet, spare pair of ballet-flats and some snacks for the flight.  And - just to test it out - it fit under the airplane seat!\n","id":"2a4af9f0-905a-4803-9a91-5b435c558d61"},{"text":"\n  I, like many other frequent travelers, have run the gamut of laptop bags. To date the backpack has been the best performer. I have had several iterations of backpacks and after ordering this bag it has become the gold standard for my travels and use. The only feature that I am missing from my other bags in the past is the powerbag feature to charge my devices while they are stowed away during the flight. However the all around capacity, ease of use and design of the Atlas backpack blows away anything else I have used in the past. So much so that I do not even miss the charging capability of the powerbag,In this bag I carry the following:1. 17\" Laptop, travel charging kit for laptop2. Nexus 73. Nexus 54. 2-3 Folders for documents, receipts5. 3 subject Spiral notebook6. glasses case7. Wireless Headset8. Over the ear noise canceling headset9. Mini wireless router (travel router)10. WD 1TB external HDD11. Wireless Mouse12. Car charger USB adapater13 3 USB AC Charging adapters14. all kinds of cables15. BT ear piece16. everything else I might need with room to spare.With my other backpacks all the above would bulge out the backpack and also weigh down more on my lower back than up around my chest and shoulders. This bag does not do either so those quick runs across the airport from gate to gate do not take out anyone else you may be running past or your back muscles. The two water bottle compartments on either side of the bag are zippered compartments so I use one of them for any medications I may need quick access to giving me even more storage options.For me the Atlas hits the sweet spot between Everki's Titan and Flight backpacks in terms of both price and capacity. I didn't want to invest more than $200 into a backpack and the Flight backpack was not large enough for my current laptop rig. The Atlas seems to have been created to target a frequent business traveler like myself.

It is a good size, not too heavy, the color is nice, but it does show finger smudge, so I find myself wiping it down often.\n","id":"095e1b19-4e9a-43ee-ba0a-8007701428ac"},{"text":"\n  This is a phenomenal laptop.

Would have been a perfect stand except with 2 17\" laptops (HP Pavilions) neither would stay on the stand with any angle at all. Larger laptops tend to have thicker bases (and are heavier) and HP's have bases that are sloped back in the front. The two hooks on the stand aren't tall enough and the laptops slide right over them when put at any angle (the silicone pads can't handle the weight on their own). Another .25\" in height for the hooks would have made the difference. The base on these laptops is .75\" thick. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars, but had to return because it just didn't work.

It was coming down to the blade, asus zephyrus m15 or the msi gs66.  I ended up with the blade because I just thought screw it and went with the most expensive one.  I have researched ALOT leading up to me deciding which to buy.  Ive seen and read the horror stories people posted on reviews and reddit about Razer's QC.  I also have seen very satisfied customers too so I prayed for the best.  Luckily my unit after I have been using for about 3,4 days now have no problem at all.  I see no major screen bleeding at all there is very small bleed on the right hand corner but basically that's it.The keyboards are not very to my liking.  I was using Lenovo Y520 before this and even on that cheap model, the keyboards were way better for me.  I think that the blade keyboards are abit too mushy for me.The speakers are also abit on the weaker side.  I wish they would just be a little more meaty.  I'm not sure how to explain it but even my old Lenovo was better and i hated those.The top part of the chassis near the screen gets VERY hot when under heavy loud like gaming.  I couldnt touch it for more than 3,4 seconds, but then again noone touches that area anyway so it doesnt really matter.  It also got cool to the touch very fast though after you stop gaming which really surprised me.All in all those are really the only thing I \"dislike\".  They really are nit picky but im actually really pleased with this device.  I will try to post here again if i encounter any problems later on.  For now i think they are great.  I also mostly see reported problems on last year's model with the i7 9th gen and this years 1660ti gpu model.  If I were you I would try to avoid those and get the more expensive one just in case.

They have some false advertisements on the page. the main one being the store page says it has a touch screen, while it doesn't.  Had to talk to 4 reps trying to add the insurance to the purchase (store page says you can add it up to 30 days from purchase) only to be told they couldn't do it. 3 of the people just hung up without saying a word. The last one said all I can do to get what I wanted is to return the laptop, wait 2-3 weeks for amazon to receive it (even though I got it in one) and then wait another week for my refund, then repurchase the laptop and add the insurance. while I would like very much to do that, I need this laptop for work as well as gaming so I can't really be without it for so long.Oh, and as it's an expensive delivery, they require a signature for drop off. I took the day off and hangout waiting for the delivery only for the amazon driver to just throw it on my porch and leave without so much as ringing the bell.TLDR; laptop is great, purchase it if you see a decent sale, just don't bother purchasing through amazon.

I will re-apply this every few hundreds hours of sun exposure to keep it it protected.

So far I’m extremely happy with this laptop. It’s a great laptop for gamers who are just starting and it definitely will do the job. Has quite a nice bright screen. It is bulky overall but not as much as you’d think. I could probably still easily put it in my backpack to take to class. The keyboard is naturally red which could be a negative for some people but you can change the brightness of the backlit keyboard which I did love. One of the coolest things is that for a lap top the ram and SSD are pretty easily upgradable so with another stick of RAM and more storage youre looking at a pretty good quality laptop here that can play you most games you probably need and good for office work at the same time. My only personal con for this lap top is that as a right handed player they put all the important things for gaming on the right side (charing port, headphone jack, and USB for the mouse), so if you need to have them in all at the same time can be quite annoying to deal with in terms of cable management. It doesn’t really have any features that are too cool or special but it has an application called NitroSense used to check the speeds that your fans are going. On that application you can change it to high performance or max fan power if the game you are playing requires it. Personally I thought it was worth every dollar especially as a place to start if you’re kinda of behind and are on a budget like me.\n","id":"98a627af-f21d-4a5a-a883-dfbd82d48e4e"},{"text":"\n  At $579.99 for the AN515-54-5812 it's A REAL DEAL!!!

I hesitated for a while at first as I had seen many negative reviews regarding gigabyte laptops but after having used this laptop for a while now, I can safely say it might just be the best laptop I've had in a while.Build quality: The build quality on this laptop is fantastic, all aluminum so it feels really premium. It also has a really nice design in my opinion. Really muted which I happen to like. My only concern is the hinge. The hinge just doesn't seem tight enough? It causes the display to shake sometimes but never when i'm typing so that's good. It's also a one hand open. Laptop is pretty light as well but the power brick, being 230watts is pretty big.Display: Wow, the display is really great here. The 4K OLED panel is really bright and really vibrant. It doesn't get past 500nits but it was a sacrifice gigabyte had to make to get good deltaE values. Contrast is amazing, color gamut is really good on here. Only down side is that it's 60hz. Hope to see high refresh oled screens on laptops sometime soon. I can see banding sometimes but I rarely notice it.Performance: The 1660ti along with the i7-9750h is a pretty good spot for me. Getting gaming out of the way, I usually get around 120fps in Apex Legends, 100FPS in Resident Evil 2, 150fps in Overwatch &  90FPS in Soul Calibur. All games were in high settings, with the exception of overwatch being at epic settings and all games were ran at 1080p. I can't push many games at 4k. In terms of Video Editing and Rendering in Unity & Blender, the 1660ti also has studio drivers on the AERO and render times have been pretty good as well as editing video has been pretty smooth, though I don't do video editing often.Thermals: Thermals on my unit weren't great... but they weren't all that bad. I've never experienced any thermal throttling. GPU temps are usually around 75c-84c under load and CPU temps are higher at around 90-92c. You can drop the temps by about 3-5c by enabling max fans, but they do get REALLY loud at that point.Keyboard & Trackpad: I love the keyboard on the AERO. The backlighting is plenty customizable and bright. The keys have a pretty nice travel distance so it feels pretty good to type on. The trackpad is glass so it's really smooth, and it has windows precision drivers so gestures and such work like a breeze. It also has a fingerprint scanner, which is quite fast and works fine for me.Software: The laptop comes with no bloatware except for GIGABYTE Fusion & the AI software, which I guess aren't bloatware because they're pretty useful for controlling fans, keyboard lighting, etc.. Almost all my drivers were out of date but hey, control center makes it super easy to update drivers and in about 30m, all my drivers were updated. I personally like and have no problems with control center but the AI software still seems gimmicky.Fan noise: Fans do get super loud under load but otherwise, I hardly hear them. As states above, max fans do sound like a jet engine. You also have full customization over the fans using gigabyte fusion.Battery Life: Battery life for me while typing docs, browsing the web, 40% brightness and keyboard backlight on was about 4-5 hours for me. Haven't tested it while gaming though.Camera: The camera is the worst part about this laptop for me. Bad quality, bad position. Rarely use it though so I don't care much. They have a privacy cover for it though so for people concerned about privacy, no tape required.I'll continue to update this review as the months go along using the AERO, but so far, really happy customer.Some other things:-Laptop has a second m2 slot for SATA&NVME SSDs, gigabyte also includes extra thermal pads for any secondary ssd you might add. The Stock SSD is really fast too.As of November 17, 2020, I populated my second m2 slot with a Sabrent Rocket 1tb nvme SSD, and have no issues with it on the laptop. Speeds are really fast too at around 2000mb/s r/3000mb/s w.-I've seen alot of complaints with the wifi card on the AERO, but wifi experience on my model has been excellent. No problems w/ download & upload speeds over WiFi on my model and no drop outs.***Update***It's been one month w/ the Aero 15 now, no issues so far. Still love this laptop.**11/17/2020 Update*My GPU fan started making a loud grinding noise after about 3 months of owning the laptop. I'm not sure what caused this, but my guess is that the bearing went out. A couple months following this, the fan completely gave out and stopped spinning completely. I decided to get a replacement fan myself on AliExpress and replace the fan. Replacing the fan was pretty easy and while I was at it, I also re-pasted my CPU and GPU with Artic MX-4 thermal paste. Following the replacement and re-paste, my fans are much quieter now and thermals are much better than they were before. I'm able to maintain 3.8ghz on all cores during full CPU load. I'm still dropping my rating by 2 stars as I am disappointed that the fan gave out in such a short time. Looking at reddit for the experience that other people had with this laptop, it seems to be a pretty big issue with this model. I'm not sure if this holds true for the 2020 model, but I can only hope it's fixed. Other than this, I have had no more issues with this laptop and everything has still been fine, especially performance now following the re-paste. The fan model for anyone curious is: PLB0701S12HH. My opinion still stands, I still think this is a great laptop, but I hope gigabyte does fix the issue with the fans. If you look on reddit, people have guides on how to fix the fans without buying a replacement.\n","id":"5ce46d1b-3424-414d-a9e8-a0078900eee7"},{"text":"\n  I've owned this device over a month and here's my opinion:** For the look, for me, it's very good, as I need to use the device for business, so it does not look like other gaming machines with red colors and logos that make your device out of place if you're in a meeting or so.** For the build quality, it's my first high-end laptop I've used, since for me I think it's also very good.** The screen is impressive for me, and I can tell that's the best screen I've ever used.==> PERFORMANCE:Let's split this into two parts:** Windows:- The first time I'm logged into Windows, it was bulky and full of garbage and has a bad performance, then after doing a clean install it now works like charm.** Linux:Since I use Linux for work and it's the main OS I'm using on the PC and the laptop for my work, after I've installed Linux all the problems started:- The heating issue that the device reaches 80 C easily and the fans still run slow because you can't control the fans from Linux.- You also can't control Fans from BIOS even it's UEFI, so still no solution for this issue.- Contacted Gigabyte and this is another big problem to contact Gigabyte and hardly after a month I could reach them then they replied we don't support Linux and The solution they have is to work on Windows!!!- Now I can't return the device as they responded very late, and also I get this device in order to work on it mainly and besides work, I play some games, But they want me to only play games!!!==> Conclusion============- If you need a device with good customer support--> STAY AWAY FROM GIGABYTE.- If you plan to use Linux mainly on this device --> STAY AWAY FROM GIGABYTE.- If you don't care about support or Linux and need a good device in terms of built quality, perfect screen and will use windows as your main OS then you may try (I'm not responsible for this advice).==> For me, it's the FIRST and LAST laptop and the LAST product I'll use from GIGABYTE as their support is the worst support I've ever dealt with, hence support and after-sales service is essential for me.\n","id":"99445826-5c4b-4791-81fb-d96ca37cb7e2"},{"text":"\n  Pros-Oled display is gorgeous with absolutely no defects.1660Ti runs all my games externally at 1440p flawlessly (Witcher 3 with \"Hairworks\" off and Sekiro stable at 60fps on Ultra)1660Ti is compatible with Nvidia Studio, so my engineering software renders models as if using professional GPU5+ hours of realistic battery life on a gaming laptop with 4k displayBuild Quality is excellent.

The 10th gen I7-1051OU handles tasks like it's nothing. I could be watching youtube than at the same time pull up an excel spreadsheet file and power point all on one screen than jump into adobe pro and render a photo or video. It is literally night and day compared to my old Coffee lake MSI. These 10th gens run relatively cool so this laptop under heavy load can get hot like 92 degrees HOT ! However at 3.2 ghtz the CPU backs down on these Comet lakes to a cooler temp around 2.6 to 2.8 ghtz.

But besides the calculator I don't really see a definitive use for it.

The back lighting is just ok to me not very bright and some keys I notice do not light up at all. High brightness on the keyboard is just weird to me. I think ASUS should have taken a different approach to this keyboard lighting entirely but hey it gets the job done.#5 How thin and light the LAPTOP is to carry around really this thing is light like 4.2 pounds for a 15 inch laptop wow that is amazing.So in conclusion do I recommend this laptop?yes absolutely I do however I would save your money and if you want 4K it will cost you round $200 more for the blue and gold edition just get the silver icy lake like I did and instead of $1399 you pay $1199 ha ha your choice but I think the Icy lake silver IMO is the way to go and plus will save you some money.Bottom Line: If you want a fast performing multitasking laptop with some light to medium gaming on the side than this is the laptop for you.On a side note before making this purchase for the Zenbook 15 I did look and research the ASUS G14 laptop with the AMD 4900HS in it and the HEAT?? is what helped me make my decision to buy this one. The thermals were way to high for my comfort. Hope this review helps in your purchase decision for this Ultrabook high performance Laptop.\n","id":"4ca4b802-9a87-4935-b512-0fe95b55e933"},{"text":"\n  This laptop is exactly what I expected it to be. However, as two other reviews have mentioned, there is an issue with internet connectivity.My device will randomly disconnect from the internet sometime during its usage about 4/5 times that I power it on. It struggles to reconnect to the network. I then have to manually reconnect it and almost always, within the hour, it will disconnect again.My laptop is 14 days old at this point in time, with this issue appearing on day 2. I have used it primarily for gaming thus far, so It has definitely been a nuisance.I plan on returning this, and getting the same laptop as a replacement. Hopefully it is just an unlikely bug.Update (7/14/2020):It has been a little over a week and one month now that I have had this laptop. I did not end up sending it back. After more in-depth troubleshooting, the solution ended up being a network reset. I had to go to my settings and select \"Network Reset\". Windows automatically uninstalled and reinstalled my network-related drivers, and I have had no issues for the last 4 weeks.For anyone else who happens to have this issue, that is my suggestion. Great laptop. It's unfortunate that network bug is there, but I am very happy with this overall! It is great for a productivity/entertainment laptop!Update (8/16/2020):The issue has returned again over the last couple days. Interestingly only while playing a video game. Looks like I will be doing another Network Reset.\n","id":"88545756-d99c-458d-a542-5a5c7b2ee698"},{"text":"\n  [user for ~1 month] I bought this laptop to replace my previous machine, an Asus ZenBook from 2013. Of course, any upgrade from seven years ago is going to feel like a big leap forward. Still, I was anxious; there were lots of little aesthetic things I loved about my old ZenBook -- the large keyboard with a numberpad, the matte screen, the slim dimensions --  and I didn't want to lose them. After spending a ton of time researching new machines, I decided to stick with Asus in an effort to retain some of the less-quantifiable qualities that I fell in love with on my last ZenBook. In short, that was definitely the correct move.BEST FEATURES- 4K UHD Screen. To be honest, I didn't know what this was (like I said, I was running a machine from 2013). I've never cared much for fancy screens when it came to phones or TVs, so I didn't think I would care about this, either. But straight out of the box, this screen is gorgeous. Everything is just so much clearer. You go back to looking at another screen, and you can't help thinking, \"How did I ever look at THAT?\" It makes everything you do on the computer much more pleasant to see. (Note: It's glossy, not matte, which I thought would bother me, coming from a matte screen. Indoors, I hardly notice, and the incredible 4K display makes it feel worth it. Outdoors, though -- yeah. You can't see anything in direct sunlight.)- SSD speed. Task manager says the SSD is a Samsung MZVLQ512HALU-00000, and it's really freaking fast. (Note: I was a little anxious that 512GB might not be big enough, so I bough an external 512GB drive, and that's definitely the move. With the fast USB-C connection, and the tiny size (and light weight) of external SSDs, it's easy to pop one in and double your storage capacity whenever you need it.)- Weight. This is lighter than I realized; I can comfortable carry it around in one hand supporting the base, screen open, while walking from room to room. It's no feather, but I it came in under what I anticipated.- Screenpad. It's obviously a gimmick. I hardly use it. But it's still really cool. And I have found a use for it in watching software tutorial videos; you can put the video on the screenpad while you follow along full-screen in the software environment.WORST FEATURES- No Ethernet port. I knew that going in, although I was hoping it would come with an adapter (it didn't; I bought one). It's a shame, but not a deal-breaker.- Adapter/charger. This is actually better than the one that came standard with my last ZenBook, so thanks, Asus, for stepping up your game -- but it's still inferior to off-market adapters, simply in that the cables are too short. Give us longer cables, so we don't need to sit near an outlet! (Fortunately, these are easy to buy.)- Color choices. Don't get me wrong, the machine is pretty. Still, the rose-gold is -- an odd accent choice. I probably would've preferred straight silver. And more seriously, the keyboard keys don't have enough contrast in color between the letters themselves and the key. The keys are a light silver, the writing is also silver -- or transparent? The backlight shines through beautifully, so that's great, but in normal lighting, these colors are very close, and harder to see. You'll just have to get close to your keyboard, or type without looking.- Power button. The power button is a keyboard button, sitting in the number pad region of the screen. That seems like a bad idea. I haven't accidentally hit it yet, but it's coming.- Slimmed down number pad. It's awesome that they managed to pack a 15.6\" screen into a smaller chassis, largely by minimizing the space between the screen and the edge of the laptop. But that means a smaller keyboard. This laptop offers a number pad, but they made sacrifices -- so there's no dedicate home, end, pageup, or pagedown keys. I never realized how often I use them to skip along lines of text, until they were gone. You can get at some of these strokes with with SHIFT+NUMPAD combinations, but there are limitations. Also, those up/down arrows are tiny (though that hasn't bothered me, yet).- Numlock. The key doesn't have an indicator light. This makes zero sense. Asus managed to put indicator lights on caps lock, power, and their freaking \"fn\" key. It would've take two seconds to add a light to the numlock. I think they just forgot? So now I never know when it's off/on.OTHER NOTES- Sound is fine (stronger than my last machine).- USB-C + 2xUSB is more than enough ports.- The F12 \"Asus\" button is silly. Bring back the FN airplane mode toggle.Overall, I love the machine. It's a big step up from those of us living in 2013, and it's surprisingly light and fast (as long as, like, you know you're not buying a Chromebook). But mostly, have I mentioned the screen?\n","id":"483b6f8b-022e-47b3-b1b6-f7fc3eb65b49"},{"text":"\n  While watching netflix the other day, my laptop's hard drive finally died...

I use it on my Raspberry Pi 3B+ as well as my laptops and desktop. My monitor arrived with the OSD set to Italian, but it wasn't difficult to change that to English. The OSD was easy to navigate after getting familiar with the controls.The monitor seems solid. It's not light weight at just over 2 pounds, but reasonable (to me) when taking into account the sturdy build.  Adding on the cover/stand increases the weight to almost 3.5 pounds. It now has some time traveling with me and is holding up well, albeit for only 5 weeks at this point. Attached is a picture of the monitor while attached to my desktop GTX 980 ti and a standard Windows 10 background.The IPS panel is acceptable. Motion seems to be fine while watching video. The screen looks fine aside from some backlight bleeding in the bottom right corner and just to the left of center on the bottom, . Fortunately, for me, I rarely can notice the bleed, so I'm not concerned about it.  I noticed one of the screws on the side is somewhat \"stripped\", so taking it apart might be a little challenging if required someday, but not a big deal. I don't see any dead pixels. Viewing angles are acceptable. The speakers aren't anything special as they have little to no low range, but I didn't purchase this for the sound.Basically, this monitor is doing exactly what I wanted it to do, and has delivered what I expected of it.\n","id":"c00ffd0b-3fda-43ba-953e-4127b8a4763c"},{"text":"\n  This monitor distinguishes itself with art.

I chose the metal, since the simple plastics used by small companies are not as strong as from large makers. The CNC aluminum frame is a nice job. It may help in evening out local heating effects from a laptop fan.The contents did not match the illustration. A hard stand was not included. A screw-on jacket, with protective cover is, and is probably more useful. I recommend a wire stand.Two cables were included:mini-HDMI to HDMI,  and HDMI--HDMI. This second cable has no use!

There were smudged fingerprints on the case.  That was strike one. Strike two was it the touch screen did not work. they do not make it clear enough in their marketing material posted for sale that the touch screen only works when it's configured in a particular way. And perhaps the worst issue which I will call strike three is that it requires a USB C interface and our laptops at work are old school so in order to use the monitor I had to use I can't remember now either HDMI or a Serial port and in either case my Dell from work did not like it at all. That meant the touch screen feature functionality I really wanted was a no-go. They are not alone as manufacturers take shortcuts to make the products cheap it puts a burden of conductivity and interfaces on the customer suffice it to say there is no bi-directional HDMI to USB C so the laptop as master needed to be in the driver's seat.

(Nexigo states that it is 100% sRGB accurate). It comes with a \"smart cover\" which is basically a hard sleeve that doubles as a stand. It's supplied with a screen protector, and a variety of cables so that you have different connectivity options depending your set up. The supplied cables are of sufficient length to accommodate left or right side placement, and the display supports rotation, if you prefer to have the ports on the left side instead of the right.PerformanceGiven its price point, I had low expectation regarding performance, and the fact that it will sit side-by-side with the excellent 2880x1800 15\" retina display on my Macbook Pro. The reality is, I'm blown away by how the difference is practically indiscernible. I worried it wouldn't be bright enough, but it's as bright as my Macbook Pro. I worried I would have to spend a long time calibrating it for color accuracy and matching, but it was color accurate out of the box, and matched my Macbook Pro display. The \"Q\" in QLED allows it to have incredible contrast with true blacks, bright whites, a wide color gamut (100% sRGB) and greater brightness compared to an LED display.I am a video editor and run 4 monitors: My Macbook Pro display, a 35\" LG ultra-wide above it for my editing timeline, a 22\" HP display to the left as a permanent playback monitor and now, the Nexigo 15.6\" display to the right. Not only does the Nexigo fit right in, but it stands its own ground in the mix with its sharpness, vibrant colors and color accuracy.VersatilityI picked this display up to give me some portability options. I can use it in my primary set up as a 4th monitor, as well as second or portable display with my Mac Mini. It's very light (less than 1.5lbs) and thin (0.19\"), so I can also slip it in my laptop bag next to my Macbook Pro, and take it on the road with me, using it as a much needed second monitor when I'm at a hotel, or working away from my studio. It saves me trying to cart around a monitor with a power adapter and multiple cables. The fact that it powers via the device you are using it with is a big win to me too.Features and ConnectivityIt has a full function USB Type-C port. If your device has a USB Type-C 3.1 port (or Thunderbolt port that supports USB-C interface) and can output audio and video, you can connect the Nexigo via a single USB-C cable (supplied). It also has a mini HDMI port as well as, so if your device does not have Thunderbolt or Type-C ports, but has a full sized HDMI port (or like me, you have a hub), you can connect the Nexigo with the mini-HDMI to full size HDMI cable supplied. Note that in this scenario, you will also have to connect a cable to a Type C power port and again, the cable is also supplied (3 supplied cables). It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and dual speakers.AestheticsOf all the 15\" portable monitors I considered, this was the only one I could find that didn't have a brand logo on it. All the others had a \"Cheap Chinese Brand\" logo at the bottom. That might not bother you, but I don't like them. The Nexigo has an all metal casing which has a soft matte black finish. It looks and feels way more expensive than it is.Brand Commitment and After Sales SupportIn the instructions leaflet provided, is a commitment from Nexigo to address any problems you might have by either helping you resolve them, or processing a refund or replacement.This Nexigo monitor is on my list of the top ten tech items I've bought as far as bang for buck goes. In terms of value for money, and the benefits an additional display offers in respect of productivity, at $169 (at time of review), it's an absolute no-brainer.\n","id":"41b8bf8f-26eb-4853-9ebc-3d6f4b9e8fdc"},{"text":"\n  Very clear and high speed.

I LOVE them and have from the day they came in the mail more than two years ago. I've modified them to no end, adding a Bluetooth module, adding skins, buying earpads, you name it. But when my housing situation changed this year and I suddenly had a roommate who was always playing video games yelling like an ape... I found I needed a mic for phone calls and casual gaming. I knew I needed a boom mic but I also wanted something with audio quality. (I'm a bit of an audiophile.) Up until recently I just used my MX50's for audio and my laptops built in stereo microphones for calls. Well once you have someone in the room yelling over you, built in laptop mics start falling short and your significant other is on the other line yelling \"I'M GOING TO STRANGLE HIM LET ME AT HIM!\" So naturally I needed a solution.I love my MX50's, as stated above, and I didn't want to sacrifice the sound quality and memories I love about that headset. So I started looking at Antlion ModMic 4's and 5's (which if you're here, you may have already looked at and know they're top dollar for a 3.5 star product...) I wasn't sure I wanted to drop $50-$70 on something that would make more tangled wires and take up room to inevitably break or fail somehow. So I started looking around on Amazon. After days of scrolling through full headsets, clip-ons, lapels, everything... I found this and my jaw dropped. It literally fit the exact criteria of what I was looking for to a T... So I bought it.I love this mic already. I've been using it a lot for the last week and its been great. Fits the ATH-MX50's like a proprietary cable (which is hard for me to judge as I previously removed the proprietary lock from inside my headset) and the mic is crystal clear to the point that people on the other end have made comments about how good I sound.The only complaints I have are these:The foam pop-filter that comes with it is rendered useless because it's so janky and lose that it just slides off. (Losing it today is what prompted me to write the review.) The hole cut out was uneven, stretched and just wouldn't stayed on. I wish I had glued it on with some tacky stuff when I thought about it.The other complaint is how short the cable is. I may have simply overestimated it's length or I'm used to the cables that come with the M50X's (which are studio cables and one is almost 15 feet.) I enjoy watching movies on my desk monitor and I like to throw my feet up on the desk and recline... But I can't with this mic attachment.All in all, great solution to avoiding buying a new headset when you've got a great pair of headphones. 10/10 would recommend to anyone in the same situation, especially if your headset has soul like mine.(If anything new comes up down the road, I'll update the review to be sure I give an accurate testimony of the microphones longevity.)\n","id":"abfa7941-05ed-4421-b7fe-cdf38cd44b0b"},{"text":"\n  Edit: I have the Plantronics RIG800LX wireless headset that was made for the Xbox One.

Only negative, and it's just a slight one, is the foam pop filter isn't tight on mic. I used just a little dab of glue and now the pop filter is secure. I would recommend this mic over the BoomPro and for 1/3rd less price.\n","id":"ceb7682a-b5ef-499a-aac8-907dc8fad92d"},{"text":"\n  This thing is awesome!

The pluck and pull was nice but the surface tablet sat in to deep and was hard to pull out. The foam could not easily but cut to thickness so I taped in a piece of coroplast to space it up higher. To make it look nice I added adhesive backed velvet vinyl. The also added a soft protective finish. The stylus fit well after cutting down the pluck and pull and putting it back in. The case looked boring so I added some stickers I had collected. To solve the handle issue I bought a roll of 2” Velcro. I cut down the fussy side and put it on the handle, and matching width on the bottom. I then made a latch using the opposing Velcro and stuck it to itself back to back, see photo. At this point it has been custom fit to my surface tablet, secured with a Velcro closure, and personalized with stickers I like. Now I like it but Pelican should not make it so much work to protect your investments. I would buy again but you need to go in to it knowing the obstacles you will face.\n","id":"dae33087-881e-439c-ae66-c36762292a52"},{"text":"\n  The case itself is very rugged, strong and durable. I have stood on the case and jumped a little for more than 15 seconds and I am 210 pounds, it flexed a little but not that much and it returned to its original form in seconds. When you press the middle of the case with force the air whooshes out the sides but not the front and back which immediately says its not air and water tight straight from the manufacturer which to me is extremely disappointing. But it still does have the capacity to be totally air tight because if you press in the middle very hard the air will whoosh out, the O-ring will form a seal from the pressing and it will hold a serious vacuum pressure inside the case. The vacuum pressure inside the case can be a little difficult to break when trying to open the case after pressing the middle and will not release by itself. But if you use polyester webbing with side release buckles and wrap a strap around the middle and make it very tight, you can stand on the case and no air will whoosh out which tells me that my case is now water tight after that slight adjustment. I hold my strap in place with gorilla duct tape so I don't lose it. I also don't believe that this seal problem is because pelican has lowered their standards in any way, but just that the case is one of the thinnest and smallest they have every made and by being so small the case is liable to flex a little under the weight of basic use so it just requires one extra strap to hold it firmly together.\n","id":"0d897e2a-5166-4fea-b9d6-9fb60aaf6708"},{"text":"\n  I have a 13 inch 2012 Macbook pro and it fit in this case perfectly. I never understand why people buy hundreds to thousands of dollars worth of hardware and then don't protect it, so do yourself a favor and buy yourself the case. As you can see in the pictures, this model comes with the pick n pluck foam. It's super easy to pick off for the shape you need. There's enough space to have one inch of foam surrounding the Macbook, so if you have a laptop bigger than 13 inches, I probably wouldn't recommend you purchasing this case. Other reviews state that the case has a faulty latching system and that it opens on its own, I have no idea what in the hell they're doing with their cases for that to be happening. If you're normal and put your laptop in the case, close it, put it in your bag(which I'm assuming is no more than a few feet away from you), go wherever you need to go, take the case out of the bag, rest it on a surface, which again I'm assuming is no more than a few feet away from you, open it, and take the laptop out of the case, you should have no problems. Otherwise, use a velcro strap like another reviewer stated if you're going to be playing football with the damn thing.Other reviews have also said it's not waterproof and there's a gap in the seal or whatever. Again if you're normal and you're not going scuba diving with it or decide to submerge it in the sink wishing it was your child, then you'll be fine. How about you complainers get a rain fly for your backpack and that way everything stays dry?My bag rolled off the couch with this in it and my macbook was just fine. No cracked screen or damage of any type. I may decide to pack my laptop in checked luggage next summer, and I know it'll be safe if it's in this, especially with the careful and delicate hands of airline baggage handlers.The only con I can think of and it's not the case's fault, is that you will feel a difference in weight in your bag. Now the 2012 13 inch macbook pro is a heavy son of bi#@h, and with this case it gets a bit heavier, which is a simple law of physics that mass + mass = more mass, but at least your machine is protected. If you fancy types can afford macbook airs and drop thousands for that or have other 13 inch laptops that are lighter, then you're much better off because the added weight will be negligible, so spend the extra $80 and get yourself this case to protect your hardware. A little extra weight won't kill you and if it does then the world will be much better off without you.\n","id":"90022c4f-251d-4311-b1ff-44b2cc259de9"},{"text":"\n  Same issue as other reviewers.

To me, the 1490 just steps into the 'won't fit in my backpack or duffle bag easily' category. No big deal, but for some it may dissuade. I appreciate the roominess of the 1490 a little more than the 1470, not for the added foam protection, but for the placement of the laptop, power bank and charger.If you are thinking about the 1470 vs 1490, both will accommodate a 15 inch laptop (Toshiba Satellite) with ease, however even at a pound heavier and noticeably larger the 1490 won me over due to charger room.\n","id":"15e10f8b-704d-4b68-9333-9a112ae58e2f"},{"text":"\n  Just a quick update to my previous review.

It surpassed my expectations. This is not at all like those flimsy stands that keeps on moving and changes their angle whenever the laptop is kept on them. On the contrary, this stand is actually very strong and sturdy. You need to apply quite some strength in order to even adjust it, so it won't move or wobble at all. I am using it with my 15 inch Macbook Pro and it works flawlessly. The appearance is neat and not too shiny which seems perfect. They have also included rubber padding on the stand to save your laptop from scratching. I think it is a must have investment for people who want to use a laptop in their work-space.\n","id":"63c08982-7000-4c23-9972-05354bd86004"},{"text":"\n  I was looking for a \"collapsible\" product for using with a small projector (Vankyo V630 in my case).

It folds down to about 1.5\" high and fits in my rolling laptop bag along with a bunch of other stuff. an excellent buy for me.I've used this stand for multiple teaching classes now and get lots of compliments about this stand. Works VERY well and even fits, when folded down,. in my laptop wheeled case. As these lessons are held in church classrooms for seniors, before I bought this stand...it was a case of finding whatever we could in the classrooms to elevate the projector.

The stand also has a \"Z\" shape so it can adjust to be very low and close down to the DJ or production gear in use.  This can hold large or small laptops and almost any tablet out on the market today.

Would have been a perfect stand except with 2 17\" laptops (HP Pavilions) neither would stay on the stand with any angle at all. Larger laptops tend to have thicker bases (and are heavier) and HP's have bases that are sloped back in the front. The two hooks on the stand aren't tall enough and the laptops slide right over them when put at any angle (the silicone pads can't handle the weight on their own). Another .25\" in height for the hooks would have made the difference. The base on these laptops is .75\" thick. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars, but had to return because it just didn't work.

The only downfall is that you adjust it and use friction to hold its place. This means that you’ll need to keep the Allen key tools handy for adjustments as you will need to loosen bolts, adjust, then tighten. For the price I can’t hold this against it. The laptop tray is a bit wobbly if you try to type on it, but thats not why I bought it. As a side note, where the arms attach to the vertical pole they use plastic “bushings” which allows the arm to pivot without loosening the bolts.I’ll probably buy another one, it’s that good.\n","id":"62d9b3f6-f5d1-4332-a464-44857663af3b"},{"text":"\n  I have been looking for a separate monitor and laptop stand for a while now and recently came across this set up from WALI. For under $50, I was a little nervous about the quality before it arrived. I had no reason to be concerned. It is a SOLID set up. Everything is high-quality metal construction and secure when assembled. Set up took some doing but only because I am not the most, um, detailed direction follower...Make sure you tighten the tray and post screws TIGHTLY initially to prevent any kind of movement after you've assembled it (don't ask me how I know).I have a 15'' Asus laptop and the lip on the tray holds it fine as long as I don't tip it too far forward. But it's an unusually thick laptop body so I imagine most won't have an issue. Again, it's not a problem for me at all, just limits slightly the angle I can tilt the tray.If you are ok with the configuration shown in the primary product image (i.e., monitor above tray) then it will be no problem as is. My desk isn't that deep so I had wanted them to be side-by-side. I was able to set it up that way out of the box. But my monitor was just a hair too big and it cast a shadow on the laptop monitor in the side by side configuration. Support was kind enough to send me a second base post and screws so I could use the grommet and clamp bases at the same time (as is you can only use one or the other). This of course only works if you already have a hole in the desk (or are willing to put one in yourself). Many thanks to WALI's support crew for accommodating me.I use a standing desk. If movement while you type is something you're fussy about (I'm not) note there will be some shake, especially in the standing position. But for most, it should be absolutely no problem.Overall a fantastic deal. Highly recommend it!\n","id":"81f9aad5-99e2-483c-a547-b1d1582df594"},{"text":"\n  Awesome design and quality and a fraction of the price!Very heavy duty, came with well crafted instructions.

I attached mine to an older model Ergotron workstation cart so it is being used in both stand-up & sit down and it does so wonderfully!  Although I have a separate keyboard tray with a full-size keyboard, the laptop holder is very sturdy and can easily be used regularly without it bouncing around as you type or rest your arms as you mouse around.The pole comes with an extension should you need it, depending on the size of your monitor or if being used as a stand-up station on a fixed height desk or table.Extremely well made!  The laptop shelf would also function very well as an adjustable swing out surface for holding books, binders, or other references materials within easy sight but off the work surface.  Or to hold a small light table, or even as a writing or drawing platform (with appropriate surface pad added) as it is completely tilt adjustable - unlike other products that do not tilt.In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this one!\n","id":"66ceb4d5-fc32-4042-904c-90c78f6f9558"},{"text":"\n  Looks really solid and well-built.

Was having very strange computer problem, where my keyboard would jumble letter and my bluetooth randomly be completely missing from my computer (not turned off, but gone).

However in July I headed back into the office for a day to work and BAM all screwed up again?!? Got everything reset and cooking along. Go into the office in August, it starts happening again. I then realize... it is the DOCKING STATION. Seems easy. I spend an entire afternoon being transferred between departments at Dell because for some reason my docking station doesn't have an ID tag. They can't do ANYTHING without this. \"I must HAVE removed\".... umm no I didn't. Finally after about 2 hours of being hung up on and transfer some guy seems to be able to help. I am on the phone with him another hour and he has me email him pics of my Amazon invoice, pics of the docking station. No problem, they'll get it out. The next day my case is \"closed\" and I am told by email to call again and they will restart this.  Then they can't get me routed to the correct place again. This has now went on for 30 days of being promised it was handled to have it closed and have different person tell me to call to start a new case. I have asked for them to start a case based on the history of emails I have, as I do not have another 1/2 a day to have them transfer me around, sit on hold, and be hung up on.

But I never got around to sending it back soooo it was wrapped and put under the Christmas tree anyway and I guess I can eat my words because my son loves it. He has the leap frog phone that is super awesome already so when he saw the leap top he was stoked. He is 3 and a half and just starting to understand that there are abcs and things so he likes to play with it. We did a bunch of traveling the week after Christmas and he played with it for the almost 3 hour car ride up and back the majority of the time. He grabs his leap top and his phone and plays \"office\" with them. His older cousins enjoyed messing with the thing as well. I'm talking 5, 9, and 11 year olds. I wasn't pleased that some of the features weren't as impressive as described but my son doesn't care. He likes it. A great toy for car rides or chill time. The volume had two levels and the lower level isn't annoying in the car. I'm tempted to buy another for my almost two year old to have for car rides, we travel a lot and I'm not ready to go for utter zombie children with a DVD player in the car yet so this is a good alternative. Overall I can't believe I'm saying it, I would recommend to a friend. It is small, has staying power(meaning he will play with it for good chunks of time) and it doesn't annoy the tar out of me so there you go, buy it. And especially buy the leap frog phone too, that thing is the best toy phone on the market right now.

Gimmicky features that stop responding and required to be forced stopped or touch pad being nonresponsive are the two consistent ones. Luckily I use peripherals and don't care for the ASUS bloatware/monitoring software.For the price point I'm satisfied and would recommend this machine or a cheaper model.EDIT: I started to have issues with peripherals connected to both USB C and USB A hubs. I was regularly having ASUS apps not responding. I did a clean install three days ago and have yet to have any of these issues (though I have ordered another USB C hub).No product is perfect. But a clean install is a must.\n","id":"1b9bc352-9492-401a-8f3c-eb93745021c7"},{"text":"\n  First up, when it worked this was a fantastic laptop but unfortunately straight out of the box it wouldn’t stop crashing.

It was coming down to the blade, asus zephyrus m15 or the msi gs66.  I ended up with the blade because I just thought screw it and went with the most expensive one.  I have researched ALOT leading up to me deciding which to buy.  Ive seen and read the horror stories people posted on reviews and reddit about Razer's QC.  I also have seen very satisfied customers too so I prayed for the best.  Luckily my unit after I have been using for about 3,4 days now have no problem at all.  I see no major screen bleeding at all there is very small bleed on the right hand corner but basically that's it.The keyboards are not very to my liking.  I was using Lenovo Y520 before this and even on that cheap model, the keyboards were way better for me.  I think that the blade keyboards are abit too mushy for me.The speakers are also abit on the weaker side.  I wish they would just be a little more meaty.  I'm not sure how to explain it but even my old Lenovo was better and i hated those.The top part of the chassis near the screen gets VERY hot when under heavy loud like gaming.  I couldnt touch it for more than 3,4 seconds, but then again noone touches that area anyway so it doesnt really matter.  It also got cool to the touch very fast though after you stop gaming which really surprised me.All in all those are really the only thing I \"dislike\".  They really are nit picky but im actually really pleased with this device.  I will try to post here again if i encounter any problems later on.  For now i think they are great.  I also mostly see reported problems on last year's model with the i7 9th gen and this years 1660ti gpu model.  If I were you I would try to avoid those and get the more expensive one just in case.

They have some false advertisements on the page. the main one being the store page says it has a touch screen, while it doesn't.  Had to talk to 4 reps trying to add the insurance to the purchase (store page says you can add it up to 30 days from purchase) only to be told they couldn't do it. 3 of the people just hung up without saying a word. The last one said all I can do to get what I wanted is to return the laptop, wait 2-3 weeks for amazon to receive it (even though I got it in one) and then wait another week for my refund, then repurchase the laptop and add the insurance. while I would like very much to do that, I need this laptop for work as well as gaming so I can't really be without it for so long.Oh, and as it's an expensive delivery, they require a signature for drop off. I took the day off and hangout waiting for the delivery only for the amazon driver to just throw it on my porch and leave without so much as ringing the bell.TLDR; laptop is great, purchase it if you see a decent sale, just don't bother purchasing through amazon.

I was looking for a a good quality speaker that I could connect to my computer, and also do phone calls with. I was looking for something compact that I could place right below my 27” monitor, to avoid clutter on my desk. This soundbar has both - AUX in and Bluetooth connectivity too, which works perfectly for me. With Bluetooth, I’ve connected my phone to it, and with the included 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm male cable, I’ve connected my laptop to it. There is also a 3.5mm audio out connection available.I’m able to switch back and forth whenever I need to take phone calls very easily.In terms of sound quality, the soundbar is pretty good. I’ve only been using it at 10% volume else it gets really loud. There’s also a volume knob on the right side that can be used for multiple purposes - skipping tracks, Bluetooth mode.The device is reasonably priced, and is a great value for its features.Overall I’m pleased with the device and would recommend it.\n","id":"9314b6c0-b2ed-44f6-8124-291ec9ed3c36"},{"text":"\n  Best feature imo is the volume knob!

Less cable mess, cleaner look, for a slight downgrade in sound compared to the soundbar with a chunky AC adapter (natural given AC->usb powered. All in all, great product for the price. Did I mention there’s a volume knob?\n","id":"bcdcc08e-20ad-4ca5-b993-46f96d21a075"},{"text":"\n  I got this as a replacement for the built-in speakers in a Windows computer that I use occasionally. I was hoping to be able to use it for Bluetooth calls too but… nope.SD Cards, Monitor, and Notebook for scale.Here’s my breakdown from WORST to BEST features:==================Bluetooth Audio: 0-Star==================The Bluetooth didn’t work with my iPhone SE at ANY distance. It would glitch and cut out every 15 to 30 seconds. I took the magnetic case off my phone, placed the speaker away from glass and metal… no dice.Also, BT always starts OFF - any time you power it on, you have to double click the volume button to activate the BT - which sometimes takes more than one try.Granted, I’ve never had a bluetooth device that worked reliably well, but I’ve had devices that would work for 30 minutes+ without glitching. It could just be my phone or my environment, but in my book this speaker would be better if the BT feature was absent.=======================Bluetooth Microphone: 0-Star=======================Absolutely terrible. Again, it would be a better product if they just didn’t have this at all.==================Beeps & Chimes: (grrr)==================Whenever you put the volume to its highest level it beeps at you. Annoying. NOT when you put it *past*, but when you put it *at* that final level.I’m totally cool with a warning if I’m at 100% trying to go to 105%, but going from 95% to 100% should NOT beep.That said… I also think it may be that this goes to 11 - meaning that the amp can drive the speakers past their “sweet spot” - and so perhaps the warning beep is letting you know that you *are* past the highest recommended level.It also chimes when it turns out... meh...=====================NO USB Audio: (not rated)=====================Aux is great because, unlike Bluetooth, it always works. ALWAYS. However, since this is a computer speaker, and since it requires power over USB, it should work over USB. Meh.==================Sound Quality: 3.5-Star==================Distortion is a problem at 100% volume… but maybe it’s also not a problem.For movies and pop music, I don’t think you’ll notice it. For something that’s bass heavy (like a male author reading an audiobook), you definitely will. At 70% or so, it’s not a problem.Back in the old days speakers, amps, and EQ were all separate devices and it was hard to get right and it was easy to push the volume past the limits of the speaker.In the modern times all of those things are integrated, so there’s no excuse to allow the volume to drive the amp past the speaker’s comfort zone into its distortion zone. Poor form.On the flip side, however, sometimes a file has the mixed volume too low, so it’s nice to be able to push the amp “to 11” (above “100%”).Obviously you give up true stereo sound - but it's a sound bar, so that's expected. No penalty.================Power Cable: 3-Star================It’s the perfect length but it is NOT DETACHABLE. So when it breaks, it breaks. No swapping out for a new USB cable.This is DIFFERENT FROM THE PICTURE, which shows a detachable cable (at least in one of them).=================Volume Knob: 4-Star=================It has an actual rotating knob! Yay!However, it’s still completely digital, and it has the horrendous beep whenever you hit max volume.================Daisy Chain: (bonus)================Has an Aux Out to daisy chain with another speaker. Good form. +1.=====================Volume of Volume: 5-Star=====================Not “loud”, but “fills the space”.It’s not that this is really packs a punch per se, but rather that the sound carries well. This is perfect for a desktop speaker for the common things you do with a laptop or iPad and being able to walk down the hall and still hear it well.===================Size / Portability: 5-Star===================Perfect. Couldn't be better.It’s a nice compact size that’s easy to fit in any location. Again, excellent cable length.=================Value at $50: 4-Star=================I wish I had tried more brands of these to say for sure, but this is my first sound bar so I don’t know for certain.If you want compact and convenient… most other options are either so cheap I’m suspicious that they could be any good at all, or you’re jumping straight to the $100 price point.If you’re just looking for desktop speakers and quality and volume are important, I’d say something like the Creative Pebble Plus at $40 is a better deal. (I own Creative speakers for another setup and I LOVE them, but this is more convenient, fewer cables)I’m glad I have this. I’ll use it.Keep in mind that I’m used to Apple products. You pay a premium, but they work perfectly. Every time (almost). They have very nice speakers built-in (both laptop and screen) which are perfectly matched to their amps, and I also have a $600 over-ear headphones + amp combo sitting right next to my mac that I use for listening to music while I work (DT-880s, no doubt worth every penny if you swing the full spectrum from classical to pop and beyond) - so keep that in mind. It may be that I’m a little too critical of what this little guy does for the price.Except the Bluetooth, that's truly terrible in every way.\n","id":"f463cc6b-5000-452e-ae79-000fa54555c9"},{"text":"\n  I was in need of a new speaker set for my home computer and this looked like a good option.

I have been buying TaoTronics products on Amazon for several years and I have always been happy with them (headphones, BT transmitter, most recently a massage gun!). Build quality of this speaker is very good and sound quality is good too. If you are watching lots of movies on your computer, you may want something more, but I think this soundbar could be used on a small TV in a small room too (Like 32\" or smaller).

You know how they often doctor up photos to make them brighter than they actually are?  This doesn't, it's beautiful.  Whether daytime or night, the colors are bold, vibrant, and make any laptop far more amazing.  I have an HP Omen 15 Studio and this has a lot of space to spare.  What's nice about a 15\" laptop is that the entire computer is flushed with the ventilation system, but you could easily get a 17\" on here and both items will perfectly align in size, guaranteed nothing will hang off.I like the stand system.  If I'm playing a video game, I don't want a computer overheating and the amount of space below the laptop is extremely useful.  I have a rear vent on my laptop and the hot air just rises straight up and out.  I would be playing both Final Fantasy 14 and 15 on 4k settings and being so hot that it burned my fingers, now it doesn't.Which brings me to substance.  My computer went from burning your skin hot to warm, and that's a massive difference when it comes to electronics.  I would take a stroll around the open world and my computer's temperature started getting very concerning.  Now I'll occasionally feel the laptop and it won't be anywhere near that.I do concur that it's a little annoying that all the buttons are in the back.  Realistically, you're not going to turn the entire machine around, you're going to reach your fingers back until it feels like it could be a button or dial.  Fortunately only one dial for fan speed, so you know which one you're touching.  There's also a click in the dial when the fan is off, so you know which way you're turning it.Also, it really is whisper quiet.  I can't tell when the fan is on unless I double-check and click the switch.I did worry about it being one single fan, albeit a large one, but I'm impressed how cool my laptop has become, and I can't argue with the results.  If it was a pretty RGB light with no real strenght, this review would be all 1s.Hopes for 2021 Model:  put the buttons on the side, maybe try for USB-C because I don't use the 2nd USB port as auxilary power (1 USB 3.0 is perfectly fine to power the entire deal, so I do my best to tuck away that ugly 2nd cord hanging there), and throw on two USB-C ports (in and out) right on the machine as a hub.  USB-C really is the future and now that you've got a solid old-school USB, there's no reason why you can't sell a USB-C version.\n","id":"a7d05d37-b740-45fd-80fd-15b09c40b698"},{"text":"\n  The product is not a cooling pad.

My ultimate reason for this decision was having a single, large fan and the ability to adjust the angle. I suspected that some of the competing stands with multiple fans had to be louder. Since I use my MacBook Pro as part of my Zoom conferencing set up, with highly sensitive condenser microphones, it was very important that the cooler stand was quiet. As any recording musician can tell you, microphones hear EVERY sound in the house! The KLIM Ultimate is very quiet: barely noticeable during Zoom meetings. The fan does keep the surface of the laptop chilly. However, I also cleaned out the dust inside my Mac and replaced the thermal paste, so it's difficult to know how much the improved performance (complete lack of thermal throttling, MUCH faster processing times for CPU intensive things like iMovie video exports, etc.) is due to the KLIM Ultimate and how much is due to fixing my Mac. I don't use the lights at all, but it's fun to know they're there. The size is perfect for a 15-inch MacBook Pro, and I REALLY like the adjustable tilt, not only for desk use, but also for the lap or watching movies in bed. Only complaint: I'm not sure what the hell I'm supposed to do with the dual USB power cable; where is that extra male USB supposed to plug in? I would understand if it was a female USB, so you could plug another device into it. This just gets in the way. But, it is nice that the power cable is detachable from the cooler stand, unlike some stands that have it dangling on it all the time. I also like that the stand has rubber feet so it sits securely on a desk. So far happy with the KLIM Ultimate.\n","id":"e6c71947-3894-4c08-8910-471b5d36d2d6"},{"text":"\n  I bought this because I work on ships and a backpack is ideal for carrying tools and parts up the mast.

It will take it.Industrial quality bag with an office feel.  Perfect for the active manager.  I've pulled this baby out with it's contents and absolutely floored 100's of people with the solutions that it's contents can provide in every type of situation.  Laptop, project files well protected.  Tools diverse and well organized.  Builds character hauling it everywhere.  I am 5'9\" 210 very muscular build.  I move this bag a lot.

Seriously, beat the living daylights out of this thing and walk into a 3rd floor office in 2 hours.  Great solution to a unique, but common problem.Update:I've been using this bag daily for over a year and a half now.  It still keeps it's shape well and is holding up.  There are no ratty looking edges or seams and the PVC bottom is still holding up well.  Other than the cloth straps mentioned in other reviews I have experienced no issues at all with this bag.

I travel to customer's sites and work in their data centers, so I often need peculiar tools depending on what type of system I'm working on. I have a lot of various tools that I don't use at every stop.As other reviews mentioned, the tool straps are not elastic. They are cloth. If your tool happens to fit in the compartments, then they work great and have extra rigidity because they aren't elastic. Most of my tools do not fit, meaning most of the storage compartments are useless.I'm not sure if it was a defect of mine or a \"feature\", but the main reason I returned this bag was because thhe very front pocket, which has elastic retention straps, are all sewn at the bottom. They are completely useless, I wouldn't trust them to hold a USB stick, much less a set of bits or anything. This makes the very front most pocket completely useless for smalls storage.If Swissgear spent even an hour actually trying to use this bag, I think they'd be able to rework some of the design and materials used, at which point they would have an amazing backpack. As is, though, I couldn't find a way to feasibly use this bag.\n","id":"4f3563b7-49f8-4920-8541-e9e70cfd7ba2"},{"text":"\n  This backpack is wonderful, we really like it and the material is good quality. This is exactly what I was looking for, the only minor issue was that a zipper pull was missing, this is for one of the inside pockets. I had to put a paper clip to it and I emailed the company asking to mail me a zipper pull but I received no response. It's not worth returning the backpack just for a zipper pull, but it's not nice to have a paper clip as a zipper pull either, it's kinda annoying. I wish the company would get back to me and just mail me a replacement, that would make me give them a 5 star review.

Occasionally the husband likes to work from bed and this holds it comfortably at an angle for him to see. He doesn’t need the tray for the mouse bc he uses a lap tray mouse to not put any strain on his arm or shoulder. This bed is pretty high as it is a mechanical bed on about 6-8 inch risers. It does get more reactive to movement the taller the setting on height. This would be a problem if he needed to rest his arm on the desk for a mouse.

Very well built. The only possible bad thing for some is, I can't put much weight on it before it slowly starts tilting. I see this as a good thing because it trains me to not put too much of my weight on it, making it last even longer. I'm not talking about the weight of your wrists. It is harder than that to move.

I love that each panel of the desk can tilt, including just one side to accommodate a left or right handed person to use a computer mouse or take notes on a flat surface, even if the laptop or book is being used on a tilt.

The pluck and pull was nice but the surface tablet sat in to deep and was hard to pull out. The foam could not easily but cut to thickness so I taped in a piece of coroplast to space it up higher. To make it look nice I added adhesive backed velvet vinyl. The also added a soft protective finish. The stylus fit well after cutting down the pluck and pull and putting it back in. The case looked boring so I added some stickers I had collected. To solve the handle issue I bought a roll of 2” Velcro. I cut down the fussy side and put it on the handle, and matching width on the bottom. I then made a latch using the opposing Velcro and stuck it to itself back to back, see photo. At this point it has been custom fit to my surface tablet, secured with a Velcro closure, and personalized with stickers I like. Now I like it but Pelican should not make it so much work to protect your investments. I would buy again but you need to go in to it knowing the obstacles you will face.\n","id":"5a9db13c-26fd-453e-a900-d7a520589912"},{"text":"\n  The case itself is very rugged, strong and durable. I have stood on the case and jumped a little for more than 15 seconds and I am 210 pounds, it flexed a little but not that much and it returned to its original form in seconds. When you press the middle of the case with force the air whooshes out the sides but not the front and back which immediately says its not air and water tight straight from the manufacturer which to me is extremely disappointing. But it still does have the capacity to be totally air tight because if you press in the middle very hard the air will whoosh out, the O-ring will form a seal from the pressing and it will hold a serious vacuum pressure inside the case. The vacuum pressure inside the case can be a little difficult to break when trying to open the case after pressing the middle and will not release by itself. But if you use polyester webbing with side release buckles and wrap a strap around the middle and make it very tight, you can stand on the case and no air will whoosh out which tells me that my case is now water tight after that slight adjustment. I hold my strap in place with gorilla duct tape so I don't lose it. I also don't believe that this seal problem is because pelican has lowered their standards in any way, but just that the case is one of the thinnest and smallest they have every made and by being so small the case is liable to flex a little under the weight of basic use so it just requires one extra strap to hold it firmly together.\n","id":"cd5e728b-6f12-4eeb-abbe-4a5253f7d5bf"},{"text":"\n  I have a 13 inch 2012 Macbook pro and it fit in this case perfectly. I never understand why people buy hundreds to thousands of dollars worth of hardware and then don't protect it, so do yourself a favor and buy yourself the case. As you can see in the pictures, this model comes with the pick n pluck foam. It's super easy to pick off for the shape you need. There's enough space to have one inch of foam surrounding the Macbook, so if you have a laptop bigger than 13 inches, I probably wouldn't recommend you purchasing this case. Other reviews state that the case has a faulty latching system and that it opens on its own, I have no idea what in the hell they're doing with their cases for that to be happening. If you're normal and put your laptop in the case, close it, put it in your bag(which I'm assuming is no more than a few feet away from you), go wherever you need to go, take the case out of the bag, rest it on a surface, which again I'm assuming is no more than a few feet away from you, open it, and take the laptop out of the case, you should have no problems. Otherwise, use a velcro strap like another reviewer stated if you're going to be playing football with the damn thing.Other reviews have also said it's not waterproof and there's a gap in the seal or whatever. Again if you're normal and you're not going scuba diving with it or decide to submerge it in the sink wishing it was your child, then you'll be fine. How about you complainers get a rain fly for your backpack and that way everything stays dry?My bag rolled off the couch with this in it and my macbook was just fine. No cracked screen or damage of any type. I may decide to pack my laptop in checked luggage next summer, and I know it'll be safe if it's in this, especially with the careful and delicate hands of airline baggage handlers.The only con I can think of and it's not the case's fault, is that you will feel a difference in weight in your bag. Now the 2012 13 inch macbook pro is a heavy son of bi#@h, and with this case it gets a bit heavier, which is a simple law of physics that mass + mass = more mass, but at least your machine is protected. If you fancy types can afford macbook airs and drop thousands for that or have other 13 inch laptops that are lighter, then you're much better off because the added weight will be negligible, so spend the extra $80 and get yourself this case to protect your hardware. A little extra weight won't kill you and if it does then the world will be much better off without you.\n","id":"92a6ac42-4883-452a-82b9-966be52d3ebe"},{"text":"\n  Same issue as other reviewers.

If you want a little added depth to maybe bring a power bank or your charger along, the 1490 will do it easily where you need use a little strategy and compromise with the 1470.Both are durable and Pelican known quality. To me, the 1490 just steps into the 'won't fit in my backpack or duffle bag easily' category. No big deal, but for some it may dissuade. I appreciate the roominess of the 1490 a little more than the 1470, not for the added foam protection, but for the placement of the laptop, power bank and charger.If you are thinking about the 1470 vs 1490, both will accommodate a 15 inch laptop (Toshiba Satellite) with ease, however even at a pound heavier and noticeably larger the 1490 won me over due to charger room.\n","id":"759b1a1c-2650-45f7-addb-99d8ea6d5a14"},{"text":"\n  Hi folks!

It does exactly what it is suppose to do which is to use it for reading. I use to use the Kindle app on my iPhone but I always got interrupted while reading as messages would pop up.Honestly, I have been hesitating for a long time in getting a Kindle as I like paper backs but with the ever increasing number of books that I have accumulated, I was running out of shelf space at home and so I took the plunge to get a Kindle and I must say, it’s a whole new experience which I am beginning to enjoy.

And to freely buy the Kindle books without having to go through the “workarounds” is to live for -- only the Kindle readers from here truly understand. :)About the shipping, I ordered it online from Amazon.sg on 15 Dec and received it on 23 Dec which was 5 days earlier than the estimated delivery date. Since it was the Christmas season, I thought there would be some delays but Christmas came early that day.  I am happy with the quick delivery and bought it at a promotional price as well.With regard to setting it up and connecting to the WIFI, I noticed that it can only connect to a 2.4GHz wireless frequency.  I am not sure if this is mentioned in the User’s Guide, but if not, I think this information should be taken note of as well.  This is because I thought my reader was defective when I tried to connect it to the 5GHz frequency - if I remember it right, the error was incorrect password but actually was not.  I also tried to tether my phone to Kindle but I hadn’t had a chance to make it work yet.  So for now, I need to connect to my home’s WIFI to update the library.Reading books from the Kindle app my iPhone vs Kindle are different experiences in itself.  With the Kindle app, it feels like I am reading from a glossy page; I can see the colors of photos but there is also a glare that I have to bear with.  With Kindle, pages look matte which is like the screen of the Magic Writer (kid’s toy where you can write on then erase with the magnetic glider) but I can read the text even under direct sunlight.  So for me, there is some getting used to when I started reading from a Kindle.Lastly, I bought the Kindle to make my commute worthwhile.

My demands aren't particularly great.  I have a 4K laptop and two old 1280x1024 monitors to give me a bit of working space.  All my ports are 3.1, regular speed (5Gb), both USB-A and USB-C.  I don't do gaming or anything demanding -- just a ton of office-type work with lots of windows open.My first attempt (not the docking station I'm reviewing here): a Targus DOCK160USZ, which I bought from a major brick-and-mortar competitor for somewhat more than I would have paid on Amazon.  (I bought it there because I had a store credit to use up.)  This unit and the VisionTek have similar specs:  2 external 4K monitors at 60 Hz refresh, 1 Gb ethernet, 3.0 USB, sound.  Even under light demand, the Targus sometimes produced blocky lines on the external monitors.  The worst part was the Ethernet, which would only support about 2 Mb/s download, which is 1/500 of its rated speed -- insufficient to do much of anything on the Internet. After a lot of debugging, I ruled out everything but the hub.  I suspect the unit is defective - no fault of the retailer, of course.  I've seen favorable reviews for the Targus.Second try:  VisionTek VT4000.  I unplugged all the cables from the Targus and plugged them into the VisionTek.  After about 15 sec of PnP port configuration, everything worked.  Everything.  I still installed the drivers on the enclosed CD, which also had good instructions on PDF files.  (The Targus only came with a tiny piece of paper with tiny print and mostly universal symbols telling me pretty obvious stuff.  They honestly didn't need to kill a twig to print it.)  I threw up three videos on the three monitors, while moving the mouse and dragging windows all over the extended desktop.  No stuttering or skipping or blocky artifacts.  Then again, I'm hardly running 4K monitors, so I wouldn't expect any trouble.  Next test was the ethernet.  I disconnected from the WiFi I had been using and ran Ookla.  Download was 120 Mb/s, and upload was 10, which is really all that's available to me in my location.  It certainly exceeded 100 Mb, so it was running successfully at the 1Gb spec -- and about 60 times faster than the Targus.Problem solved.  Yay!

Everything went well (although it was needlessly complicated and delicate), but the system would not POST.  While disassembling the system to debug the issue, my spudger must have slid under the fan socket and broke off a large portion of the socket.  Five of the six pins were still in place.  I tried to bend the sixth pin down, but it fell off as soon as I touched it.  I was able to get the system to boot with the original 8GiB, so I replaced the 32GiB and it now booted.  The SO-DIMMs are enshrouded in an EMI shield and have rubber bumpers to prevent shorting with the shield. The rubber bumpers are tricky to slide into place and the SO-DIMM retention levers are very touchy; if you breathe on them wrong the SO-DIMM will pop out.  My assumption is that the original failure was caused by one of the SO-DIMMs releasing while I put on either the rubber bumpers or the EMI shield. In any case, do not fully assemble your mac mini until you test that your system will boot after sliding the motherboard into the case and connecting the PSU.My mac mini has been stable since the upgrade. Despite losing nearly half of my fan socket and one pin, the fan cable still snapped securely in place and the system performance thermally under controlled loads similarly to intact 2018 mac minis documented on the web.Although several videos that I watched recommended using a spudger to pry off the fan cable, I later found that ifixit recommended gently pulling the cable straight up using no tools. I wish I had seen that first. Do not use a spudger on any of the cables unless necessary and when you do, make sure it is nowhere near the socket.Here's the toolkit that I used and recommend:https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GWS5G3R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n","id":"f273319d-a729-4a61-bce0-a6d0933709fc"},{"text":"\n  Product hardware is great but all the issues lie within the laptops ability to keep its self cool.

This laptop can run any game out right now and it will likely be able to run any game coming out for the next 3-5 years taking into account you may have to run them at a lower graphic setting. Because of the RTX gpu you can use DLSS and this feature alone makes a major difference not only in graphics quality but in increasing framerates also and more and more games will be supporting this in the future.

There’s no noticeable delay.Sound quality is good from both ends—sending and receiving.Drivers are simple.  Plug and play with windows 10 which is really nice.  Windows 7 needs the driver from their site[...]CONS:The adapter has too many features which hinder the users experience.  To use it to LISTEN only, you click the adapter’s button twice.  The sound quality goes up significantly.  To use it for VOIP (skype or anything that uses your mic) you click the adapters button twice again which turns off the great sound quality and it becomes only useful for phone calls.  This is an enormous con.  One which possible makes this dongle not worth keeping.  Basically this is the scenario which reduces the user experience:  You're listening to music, you get a skype call, you answer the skype call, no one can hear you.  You must reach around to wherever you've plugged in the dongle, find the small button, click it 2 times quickly, and wait for it to switch to VOIP mode.  Then you can speak.\n","id":"5cdc8a9b-c51f-4429-a2d2-df03d592876a"},{"text":"\n  Love, love, love!!! I can finally use a non over the head or true wireless Bluetooth headset with my PS4! At first I used the Anker SoundBuds Curve Bluetooth 4.1 Sports Earphones due to its long lasting battery. Now, I am currently using the Zolo Liberty+ and it's definitely the perfect fit for me!!! The Liberty+ is a true wireless headset, so the battery life is shorter, as all others, but the ability to use one or both buds makes up for the battery life. I have not used Avantree aptX Low Latency LONG RANGE Bluetooth 4.1 Adapter for anything else, sorry. I bought it with the only intention to be used in the PS4. I have other audio transmitters I use for the smart TVs. I hope this review helps anyone looking to solve the Bluetooth headset connectivity we all face on the PS4.\n","id":"12d79187-990c-4af5-b959-e783796d217d"},{"text":"\n  My granddaughter loves to smack the buttons and keyboard and is rewarded with lights and music!

When you’re traveling in countries like Europe, some hotels have limited outlets. And if you’re staying at hostels, you might just have one that is available.

It is a little noisy rolling but I totally expect something that has to roll on rough sidewalks (and bounce up curbs, swing by the extended handles over nasty things on the street, etc. ) to have a little noise to it. The extended handle is rugged and shows no sign of wear even though I'm known to swing my bag from it.  The exterior looks new. I expect the wheels to be the first thing to fail but hey, they have lasted longer than the soles of any of my shoes. My only con of this bag is how it is partially open when the extended handle is out. Even in a pouring rain my belongings only get slightly damp. My laptop stays dry as its pocket is located the farthest from the handle.  If you are looking for something for travel all on indoor surfaces I expect it will last many years.\n","id":"8f3fd377-cb83-4813-9d17-8b2373bc9f2b"},{"text":"\n  This bag and I have been all over the US and it has really held up well.  The leather still looks good, the hardware is still operating the way it should be and the handle still goes up and down smoothly despite me dragging it up and down stairs.  I can fit a lot of stuff in this bag with all of the packets and padding it can hold my big old and heavy laptop as well as protecting my tablet.The only thing that kept it from a 5 star review is that small stones or items can get caught in the wheels so you will have to stop and roll it back and forth to clear it out.  No biggie, after that you just keep rolling on!\n","id":"566c9b4c-75cd-44e3-a984-9fcce1e2338b"},{"text":"\n  It is slightly smaller than expected, yet there are three compartments to store some things but not bulky items.

It seems to be very well constructed, matches item description very well, lightweight but not poorly made, and most importantly, it does the job it was designed to do. The multi-fan settings are very convenient, the ability to adjust the height & angle of the stand itself is very usefull, and the multicolor feature is nice little added bonus that gives it a little character despite being noting more than an nice asthetically pleasing touch. So far, I have very little complaints or 'cons' to report, but if there is one that I find noteworthy, it would be this: when the stand is positioned to its highest level (steepest downward angle), my computer tends to slide downward rather than remain stationary. I mitigated this issue by placing a rubber lining matt under my computer which seems to have corrected this issue while still allowing the fan to do its job of keeping my laptop from overheating.Overall, I am pleased with the product. I wouldn't go as far to say that it exceeded my expectations, however it has met them in every possible way -- which, in my opinion, matters the most. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for something offers the various functionality & capability as this item does. I rated 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the issue I mentioned above regarding the angle causing my laptop to slide downward, however, in my honest opinion, a 4.5 rating is probably more accurate (but unfortunately, that option is not available).Hope you find my review helpful, and to anyone who might be 'on the fence' about whether or not it's worth purchasing, I would suggest pulling the trigger & giving it a shot. I think you'll find it to be a very good & worthwhile purchase -- especially considering the price you'll pay.\n","id":"8f46bee3-390c-45fc-a080-0e51dcebe165"},{"text":"\n  Using it on a PS4 that overheats with intense gaming and VR. Fans are extremely quiet, and so far it keeps it nice and cool. No more crashes or freezing. Perfect.\n","id":"1e53b2d6-a0a5-4249-a7e6-6d4fc60d8bcc"},{"text":"\n  Pros:• Pretty quiet• High, medium, low settings for the back/front two fans allow for more focused air flow and quieter function• Built in USB hub to regain lost port on the computer• Potential to operate even with computer in sleep/suspend mode --- provided computer continues to provide power to USB ports in that state (Apple Computers do)....  If your computer doesn't do so, panic not as the cooling pad will work using any USB charging station device.• Capability to draw power from USB charging stations rather than using up a USB port on the computer which is very useful for laptops that cut power to USB ports when in sleep/suspend mode.Cons:• The switches controlling the fans should really be more accessible.  At least on the side of the unit.... Having to reach around the laptop to get to the back on the cooling fan below it can be a bit of a nuisance.•  When both sets of fans are set to low, their operation becomes erratic.... They start behaving like a car engine trying not to stall, revving up and slowing back down at varying intervals.• With the fans on low, there is an annoying high pitched whine that sounds like a modem or fax machine trying to connect.... Not quite as loud as that, but the same pitch and tones -- if your hearing is sensitive to high pitches, you may want to either avoid this product or not use it as lowest setting.  Between that and the random revving thing. using the unit at low setting isn't an option.• The switch controlling the lights is in a very difficult to access space --- I don't think someone with big hands would even be able to get to it with a laptop sitting in place on top of the cooling pad.  Doesn't sound like a big deal until you consider that the unit resets to factory every time it loses power.  If you set the lights to your liking/tolerance and never disconnect the cooling pad from a USB power source, they stay as set, but, realistically, most people will need to move their laptop at some point.• Vibration is a problem with this cooling pad on hard, stable surfaces.  To be fair, this is the case for most cooling pads.  This can, however, be minimized by setting a piece of thick packing foam under each corner of the pad.  The material will act as a vibration dampener and eliminate the problem.  The little rubber \"feet\"/padding that the pad has just isn't enough to minimize vibration -- particularly when running all 4 fans on high.As a tech. often asked by my clients to recommend heat dissipation options for my clients, the cons list would rule this cooling pad out for about 50% of my clients.  I would purchase it again myself simply b/c it has been, to date, the best one I've has for my 17\" Apple laptop.  It does an excellent job of dissipating the heat from a laptop that runs very hot -- due to poor design in not having any vents to allow the internal fans to effectively push the heat out.  This is the third cooling pad for this laptop -- replacing inferior ones that literally fell apart (plastic pieces flying off and everything) -- and so far it's been the best.  The only thing that would make me think twice about repurchasing this unit is the high pitched whine in low power mode.... That may push me toward a similar product from a diff't manufacturer.Do note, that this product doesn't actually cool anything.  It simply helps move the heat given off by a laptop.  The better a \"cooling pad\" does this, the less heat builds up within the laptop's housing.  This will not help a laptop whose internal fans aren't working correctly.  In combination with properly maintained & functioning internal fans, this cooling pad will keep a laptop from overheating.\n","id":"b4538cef-8c74-4f7d-8e1b-506a80a14e5d"},{"text":"\n  I have 3 of these laptop coolers and this one is by far the best.

I typically fall into the thinking that you get what you pay for, but this was one of those rare items that made me feel like I got much more than I paid for. I have been through probably four cooling pads in the past, all cast aside because they weren't convenient, didn't cool much, or both. This thing has worked great initially. I have a 4-year-old device that just seems to get warm and lag while doing anything. Not only did this fan keep things cool and make it run faster but I even let my 7yo try his Roblox game on my computer, which he hasn't been able to get to work without extreme lagging due to overheat in about 2 years. Shockingly, it worked flawlessly, and now I can't wait to break out my games that I no longer play and give those a whirl!

I decided to do some research and found this laptop. While I love this model of Asus Zenbook for many reasons, I would recommend going with a different model of the Zenbook. I'll go through my general pros and cons of this model of the computer and my recommendation. If you don't want to read my explanation, you can just see the aspect in all caps.PROS:BUILD QUALITY: the computer has an excellent build quality in terms of its all-aluminum body, and the keyboard has the perfect amount of travel, especially compared to the Yoga, which sacrificed the keyboard for thinness. The screen is excellent for a1080p, and the thin bezels are very lovely. The ergonomic lifting hinge is pretty nice though you don't notice it until you aren't typing on another laptop keyboard. The ScreenPad works well, but I have more to say in the cons. this is my first computer with the iris scanner, and it is the greatest thing!INTERFACE: it has Windows 10 64-bit; there isn't that much bloatware from Asus on the computer. The MyAsus app on the computer which can update the BIOS on the computer and have some nice customizations to the laptop. The app includes options like partially charging the battery if you're leaving the computer plugged in often to protect the battery life, fan function, screen color customizations, diagnostic checks, warranty info, and manuals for the laptop.INNER SPECS: While inner specs are subjective to use, this laptop specs are pretty good for a business laptop or for a college student who plays light games (that is me) should guarantee that this laptop will run reliably for a good while. There is a lot of hubbub around the Intel i7 10 gen with the clocking speeds, but the results are relatively similar to the older generations, and if its an issue, this laptop has options for other generations. This laptop also has the ultrabook (thin laptop) version of the i7 inside.BATTERY: the battery on this laptop holds out for a good while if you're writing a paper or watching youtube videos, and while the charger isn't USB C, it charges the laptop pretty dang fast.FREE CASE: this model also comes with a free case, which is great for protecting this laptop in bags. It's not a fancy case, but it does the job.CONS:SCREEENPAD: The ScreenPad is overrated. There I said it. Once the new toy factor wore off, I turned it off to save battery life. While it sounds like a cool idea in concept, it isn't that useful. Lucky for you, they have a model of this laptop without the ScreenPad and a regular trackpad. I haven't had any issues with the ScreenPad; it just isn't justifiable for paying more.KEYBOARD: while the keyboard feels great for long periods of writing, the only problem I have noticed is the slight slanting of the backspace key. Maybe it's just my typing; I don't know. luckily this computer comes with a 2-year warrantyFINGERPRINTS: this computer is a fingerprint magnet, which isn't the end of the world, but just so you know.Conclusion: Overall, as I had said before, I would highly recommend you get a model of the Asus Zenbook 13,14 or 15 in, just not this one specifically. Get a model that doesn't have the Screenpad. Don't make the same mistake I made in being enticed by the ScreenPad and save your hard-earned coin to purchase the 4-year warranty offer for this computer by amazon our through Asus on the MyAsus app.\n","id":"d445e3ab-020d-40c7-9e99-a13c58744e26"},{"text":"\n  I have been using this laptop for just over 30 days and here is my feedback:PRO's:GREAT battery life (12+ hours consistently in normal use with power bar at max)GREAT build qualityVERY thin and lightGREAT Price to Performance ratioHinge Lift on screen definitely improves coolingIt is a really premium looking laptop in person and definitely looks high end for the priceCON'sFan noise is a bit too much compared to a surface or xps 13 (there is a silent mode but drops boost clock to 2.8)No touch screen (if you are into that sort of thing, I am not personally)Boost clock is a bit low when on battery (3.9g) compared to chip performance (underclocked to save power)Screen does not go full 90 degrees open which I like for laying in bed or on the sofa (but it works just fine, I am just being picky because it is a review)User Case:I am a computer hardware enthusiast.  I much prefer desktop PC's to laptops so when I set out to purchase a laptop for myself I did quite a bit of research.  For me a laptop is not for gaming but for doing work, browsing the internet, watching video and updating social media.  I wanted a machine that was lightweight, powerful enough to open large excel spreadsheets, had enough memory to manage a massive outlook .dat file had a good screen for watching video and had great battery life so I did not need to carry a charger with me.  Also, I wanted a machine that would charge using USB-C vs a barrel plug and power brick.  I also wanted thunderbolt in order to doc into my station in my office (at some point when we ever go back).  I found all of these things in this machine for under 1k.I was fully expecting to pay 1700 or more to find a machine that I liked and I was very surprised to find an intel ice lake powered machine for this price point.  I was concerned that only having 8g of ram was going to be an issue as 16g would be what I consider minimum acceptable levels.  So far this has not been an problem, even on larger excel files but then bear in mind I do not have a bunch of apps installed on this machine, mostly just MS office and Minecraft (which the iris graphics runs just fine btw).  This machine performs great, runs everything I need it to and I feel I am getting a dell XPS build quality and user experience for a lot less money.  I like the larger XPS-ish track pad and the integrated num pad is also nice.  While you are not going to do any AAA gaming on this machine that is not what you buy a thin and light to do (or really any laptop at all regardless of the marketing).  All in all I would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking to buy a good performing thin and light laptop in 2020 even with the upcoming tiger lake releases.\n","id":"24509a0d-647b-487d-b33a-79b55e336110"},{"text":"\n  Laptop is very fast and runs quiet.

So far I’ve tested on 4 TVs in my house and it doesn’t work on two of them but it does on the other two. Now on one of those supported TVs the image doesn’t adjust properly from the vertical space even when adjusting under settings etc but the other shows up perfect! So I know the cable works is what I’m getting at. What I really bought it for is so I can play my Switch on an actual Dell Monitor at work during my lunch hour and I can test that tonight. Our monitors don’t have HDMI but only VGA and DP. DP doesn’t work when going from HDMI to DP so that’s a no, and downside to VGA is it doesn’t carry audio but the headphone jack on the Switch still works in docked mode.During my 4 TV test and of the two that worked, I didn’t notice any input lag whatsoever. I’m using a 3rd party mini dock and HDMI to VGA Adapter on top of that and still no lag. That may differ when I test at work. Tested at work with no issues except the monitor only accepted 720p and showed “Mode not supported” until I lowered the output resolution on my Switch.BTW, this cable works because it has the digital to analogue converter chip built into it. Not all cables of this type do so keep that in mind. Meaning they won’t work without some sort of conversion adapter. Also as I mentioned above, VGA does NOT carry an audio signal so this may not be for all of you.Update: It works for my work monitor BUT not at first. I had to change the resolution settings from Auto to 720p and it worked. Now I believe that could of been why two of my TVs didn’t detect the signal. I later found that one of my non supported TVs actually did work but it apparently only takes VGA in at 480p.Anyways it played just fine with NO LAG that I could detect. Will be getting another for a friend in a moment.So yes this works but your needs may vary and it may not work for you but you can’t necessarily blame the cable.

Without the various documents, everything fits just barely.I prefer bags that have pockets and main compartments that open very wide. The two main compartments open halfway, which I find barely acceptable. The exterior smaller pockets are tailored to be well concealed, but I find retrieving anything from those pockets to be very annoying.

The orange color on the inside is awesome; I truly love the style of the bag. Only other downfall is that I was hoping to carry my 15.6\" HP Laptop in it. It did technically fit, but not within the laptop pocket. Because of that, it would have just been floating in the bag, or, if I put it in a laptop case, it would have taken up most of room inside the bag.

This is true.  However, the description claims \"the tabletop includes holes for cable management.\"Well, there are holes within the tablet/phone slots, but the holes are much too narrow to allow even a simple charging cable through [tried both Lightning and Micro USB].  The holes currently are 5mm wide, which is not enough.  These holes are quite useless.  Seems the only way to have them be functional is to expand the holes with a Dremel/knife/file.

It's possible that the Wahoo version is somehow superior, but I can't imagine it's twice-the-price superior. The footprint of the desk is larger than I thought it would be, but that's only a negative because I'm operating out of a small space.The instructions for assembly are rubbish (why do the castors have that nut on the bolt? Is it for leveling? Do I need it? - these questions will never be answered), but the overall assembly is pretty easy to figure out. Here's one thing - I originally put it together with the \"Rad\" stickers on the inside of the table legs - the legs seem to be completely identical so I really didn't think it mattered. The problem was that when pushing the buttons to lift the desk, one side stuck a little, you had to put your foot on the base to pull the desk up. No big deal. But just for the heck of it I took it apart and put it back together the \"right\" way. Now the push-and-lift system works perfectly. Does that mean the legs are slightly different and designed to be on either the right or the left? If that were the case don't you think the \"instructions\" would point that out? I still doubt it makes any difference one way or the other, but if you run into a sticky-up problem, you might want to give swapping the legs a shot.The only other minor quibble is that the slots that hold up your phone or tablet (which work fine for me whether or not I have a case on) have these cut-outs in the bottom - I suppose that's so you can run a power cord through them? Great idea! Except that I don't have a single micro-USB or iPad lightning cable that will fit through the cut-outs. I'll probably end up melting or breaking out some material because I really could use some power when running apps on a three hour ride.\n","id":"6fb24b62-d81d-4974-a7ca-35f520b0cf75"},{"text":"\n  I wanted a desk for in front of trainer but I didn't want to pay almost double what Wahoo was asking for their desk.

Most of the other stands I looked at would only elevate the back or the whole of the laptop about 6 or 8 inches. This one I have set at about 14 inches, and I can still type! (It will go further than that, but if it's straight up, one cannot tilt the platform back much at all before the stand WILL tip. That's plain physics and not a fault of design.) I can have it down a little further, with the platform tilted back a bit more, for a more even typing surface, or I can have it straight up for viewing. Either way or in between, it elevates my laptop for more comfortable use. The hinged areas where it moves are very stiff, which is a good thing. I have no worries about it falling down. The two lips to hold your laptop are deep enough for my chunky old Thinkpad W520 (circa 2011--sue me; I'm in love with its keyboard). The stand is sturdy and solid.

It appears to be all metal, as opposed to a a lot of laptop stands out there, which is good. However, I've worked around aluminum enough to guess this is probably a fairly cheap one. But, as long as it doesn't get dropped or banged around, should be OK. If you plan on moving this around, please be aware that it IS pretty heavy, all things considered. I only plan to move to move it on and off of my desk's keyboard tray, storing it down by the side, so I'm not too concerned by that. But keep this in mind if you are looking for portability.The joints seem pretty tight as well, requiring a bit of 'oomph' to get them in position. Pulling on one end of the 'tray' seems to rise the whole thing, with both arms moving in unison, which is nice as you really don't want to worry about slight adjustments. We will see over time if those joints loosen up, though. I imagine this may be a bigger concern if there were a heavier laptop on the stand, but I don't intend it for that.As you can see, I use this as a stand for my iPad Pro, which doubles as a graphic tablet for me. It raises the iPad up to a decent height (the stand isn't even fully extended, it can go higher), and seems to be fairly sturdy. Plus I can put my keyboard underneath.Overall, this gets four stars from me at the moment. i would've liked it to be made of a better grade of aluminum but, for the cost ($35 at the time of this review), it fits my needs perfectly.\n","id":"e5f3a7e6-2050-4704-b9ee-0f7f8f816a82"},{"text":"\n  Wow!

I consider equipment is successful if you don't have any problems, which seems like a hard thing to find these days. We got this stand, and out of the box it looks like quality, like the Lexus of laptop stands - its really a thing of beauty. It's fully adjustable. And when you get it set at the height and angle where you want it - ITS GOING TO STAY. It has tabs that hold the laptop securely and sturdy large silicone rubber pads both on the bottom and on the laptop shelf so things don't move around. Its EXACTLY what I wanted.

I've attached mine to the rear of the tray, and I'm not sure what would be the reason for choosing one over the other. Maybe the bottom mounting point is meant for mounts attached to a vertical surface, like a wall, while the rear point is for a horizontal surface, like a desk.Each of the mounting points has two holes that will fit a VESA 100x100 mounting bracket, as well as two holes for a 75x75 bracket. If your mounting bracket has holes for both 100mm and 75mm, as most that I have seen do, then you will be able to attach the tray with four screws. Otherwise, you will only be able to attach it with two screws, which probably won't be a problem since most laptops are a lot lighter than the monitors/TVs that the brackets and mounts are made to handle.The stand-offs at the bottom of the tray, that are meant to prevent your laptop from sliding off, are 7/8th of an inch tall (0.825 inches). The brackets to stop the laptop from sliding off the sides can move along the longest ventilation slot, so you can place them at a spot that doesn't cover up any ports on your laptop.I am using the tray with my Alienware 15m laptop, and it works very well with it.

The good part of this product is the mounting options for  the metal base are flexible and all the screws you need are included. That’s about the end of the positives.

This thing feels like a brick. Its solid and built like a tank.I found that while it’s a complex device internally it’s very simplistic externally. You don’t have to be in any way technical to use this device. If you know how to plug your phone into a charger you can handle this, it’s that simple.~Intelligent charger, no settings, just plug in your device and let it sense what the device needs~Operation is simple, plug in a cable and then plug the cable into your device, phone or tablet~The side mounted button can be depressed to have the display show remaining capacity~When it starts charging any device the display lights up, even something that takes very little current like a BT headset, then after a minute the display goes out to save powerThis is the heaviest power bank I have ever encountered and rightly so, it has the greatest capacity by far of any power bank I have or have looked at. If you work the numbers, 30,000mAh is 30 amps. Now the arithmetic I'm going to use here is not exact but I use it as merely an example of just how much capacity this thing has, a standard compact car battery is usually rated at a reserve capacity of about 75-90aH. what we have here is a small device that has a capacity that equals about a third of a compact cars battery. Again, please don't jump on me for the arithmetic, I'm just making a point to give an idea of how much capacity that can be put into a small space when Li-ion batteries are used. Plus this power back provides varying voltages that some devices need. You may have seen the very small \"boosting\" devices that can be used when your car battery is dead, you can get your car started with them. This is the same size physically as the one I have and has more capacity than most of those devices.How fast it can charge a phone all depends on your phone, the shape your battery is in - is it new or getting old, temperature, and other variables not to mention make/model of the device being charged. I could give you all manner of figures, capacity reached over time but this means nothing when the devices you have aren’t the same or the batteries are in better or worse condition than what I was charging.-||- The important thing here, this is a smart charger that will get your device charged as quickly as your device will allow it.~Like any good power bank there's a readout letting you know how much of its full capacity is left. This read out in percentage, see image below where it shows 66%For performance, this is a Qualcomm 3.1 certified charging device. No matter what your current devices needs are for voltage or current to achieve a fast charge this power bank can provide it. If you have a device that can fast charge at 5v, 9v plus or 12v (or somewhere in between) but only have the one charger that came with the device, this becomes your second charger. And the best part is you can charge this from any USB power source. You can have three devices charging at the same time and each one will get the right voltage and current that it needs.~Like any quality power bank it has multiple USB A ports but it also has an additional USB C port that newer devices now use~The USB C connector works as both a charging port for the power bank or for charging a phone~The micro USB port is strictly for charging the power bank batteries~The internal circuitry makes sure your devices get the right voltage and current, no over chargingTo charge the power bank you can use any USB charger or even a PC or laptop but a dedicated charger would be a better way to go. You can use the charger that came with your phone or tablet. A completely flat battery will take some time to charge, don’t expect to get a full charge in a couple of hours even with chargers that put out 2+ amps. This is the kind of thing you let charge overnight to ensure its fully charged before heading out the door.It took me a couple of days charging multiple devices before I drained the battery. At times both USB A ports were putting out their max current and the power bank remained cool. This is an important item. Electronic components don’t like heat, it causes them to break down. The cooler something is when its charging or discharging the longer it will last.**The USB connectors are a very snug fit. This is an important item that not many people think or know about. Lose connectors can actually cause damage to your attached devices. Any time a connector is lose it can move around and while it’s not a threat because of a short circuit it does cause problems. When DC power is suddenly lost and reconnected, the surge upon reconnection can cause problems throughout the hole charging circuit and it could affect your battery as well. Charing circuits and batteries alike prefer to have power brought to them slowly at a steady rate and then build up the charging current as they control it. This is a common problem with dollar store bargains both in chargers and the cheap power banks. They use poor components and can damage your expensive phone.The only negative item here is the weight but this can’t be held against it as there is no better or lighter way to get this kind of capacity in one device. You could carry two power banks that each on their own might be lighter but there’s no advantage.~The included Travel Pouch keeps it protected and it’s got enough room to store a couple of USB charging cables as well keeping everything together in one spot.\n","id":"720f46ee-7e44-4aab-bf75-c28a58bdc016"},{"text":"\n  I waited to write a review until I had to charge this bad boy.

The BCM state 25,000mAh hile the iMuto state 30,000mAh.The BCM is much lighter than the iMuto and it raised some questions. Batteries weigh. The more storage the more weight. So I tested both batteries. I charged a Samsung Tab S3 with a depleted battery while device turned off. This way, I could see the charge level and didn't have to take into consideration battery usage from a tablet sitting idle.The results didn't surprised me. The Tab S3 has a 6000mAh battery (on the sticky notes in the pictures I wrote 4450, I was wrong). The BCM managed to charge it twice before reaching 2% capacity.The iMuto managed to charge the Tab S3 4 times before I stopped trying. It went from 100% to 71%, from 71 to 42, from 42 to 13, and surprisingly, from 13 it went down to a flashing 3% for a while, but it completely filled the S3. After that, I stopped the experiment since it is undesirable to completely deplete a battery. This yield 24k mAh which is much closer to the stated capacity of 30k.The iMuto build quality, materials, and feel is much better.I give this product 4 stars.

The Dell R610 had zero issues recognizing the SSD hard drive once I booted it up.Installation went pretty straight forward, with only one minor hiccup. The holes for the little plastic bit that used to secure the cdrom to the case didn’t match up between the Dell’s cd rom and the adapter.

The metal casing for the caddy is pretty thin, little too thin is you ask me, so I had no issue driving a pilot hole into the back of the caddy to match up with the holes on the plastic locking piece.As for the overall caddy size, it was darn near identical in dimensions with the cdrom I removed from the server, darn near except that the caddy was a hair shorter in height, enough so that it left a noticeable gap when I inserted into the server. Not a show stopper, but still something someone might notice in a similar setup. This by no means affected the caddy in any way, the plastic locking bit was still ale to engage, and the SATA/Power cable (Yes I know this is not the right term for what being using on the server) was still able to connect.Overall, I was happy I spent the extra couple buck to utilize what would have been a wasted sata port on my server.\n","id":"cab95181-892f-4b82-b809-cea2b1e2bee9"},{"text":"\n  It fit my Dell Latitude E6440 good and the HDD is working well.

The keyboard is naturally red which could be a negative for some people but you can change the brightness of the backlit keyboard which I did love.

My only personal con for this lap top is that as a right handed player they put all the important things for gaming on the right side (charing port, headphone jack, and USB for the mouse), so if you need to have them in all at the same time can be quite annoying to deal with in terms of cable management. It doesn’t really have any features that are too cool or special but it has an application called NitroSense used to check the speeds that your fans are going. On that application you can change it to high performance or max fan power if the game you are playing requires it.

No issues with the velcro. It's stitched well and aligns perfectly. The dimensions of my computer are 11.4 x 7.9 x 0.30 inches, so there was a little room to spare on the side...but not much. Just enough room to fit my S pen, which is great. The pockets are a little snug with no zippers, but I knew this going in. The outside pockets fit a mobile charger and cord, but would fit a cell phone as well. The front pocket would fit an additional 10 inch tablet with room to spare. The bag is very well made and the felt material is high quality, with a soft velvety lining. Overall, I really like the look and feel of this bag. However, if you are looking for something super rugged and waterproof, this isn't it. Again, it is felt. As for me, I was looking for something light weight, slim, with a classic look...which is exactly what I got. I went with the lovely charcoal color, which I find most stylish.

Also, there are two pockets in the back of the sleeve, which would be handy to fit all sorts of little supplies like pens or a phone.Now for the negative. I have an HP Envy 15, for which the product specs say is 14.96 inches wide, which means this sleeve should fit my laptop with room to spare. Except it doesn't. The sleeve is a hair too small to fit my laptop. The problem is the seams on the sleeve. As you can see in the attached photos the seams take up just enough space on each side of the sleeve that you can't actually fit a 15 inch laptop into it. A laptop under 14.5 inches wide would fit just fine.I'm definitely disappointed I won't be able to use this, as it really is a well made product for the money.

You cannot use just any usb c charger and this adapter. The charger must put out a minimum of 45watts in order for this to work. I have a ravpower 60w battery pack that keeps my surface charged for hours. I also have another power bank with a PD port that won't charge it at all, not even a trickle! What's the difference? The watt output. The adapter works and it works well. I haven't had it for long and can't speak to it's longevity but it feels pretty sturdy and it doesn't feel cheap and creaky like the cheap plastic products. If you need an adapter and don't have a 45 watt or more adapter buy one or keep moving but don't review this like it doesn't work.

I like to understand the differences between products, state of the art, etc., and generally be an informed buyer. I've also been in \"tech\" for more than 35 years, with roles from hands on through CIO and CTO, so I've got a lot of experience researching and choosing products, whether for one person or thousands.  In short: I tend to be a picky shopper. I researched the field here, and think I've found a winner.At this point in my career, I'm traveling weekly, and I'm meeting -- either in person or remote -- with numerous people each week. Conference calls are the norm, and may involve dozens of people, conference rooms with poor equipment, offices with dreadful 15 year old \"speakerphones\", hotel rooms, working from my home office, etc. One of the most frustrating experiences is trying to participate in a mission critical conference call when 1) I can barely hear or understand the folks at the other end, and 2) they can't hear and understand me unless I lean over a mic and raise my voice. Cell phone \"speakerphones\" may be acceptable in an emergency, but haven't proven adequate for routine use.I had recently research Bluetooth speakers for use primarily as audio / music listening speakers (for use, e.g., with Google Play Music from my phone). I researched and auditioned many: Bose, Cambridge, JBL, Shark, Amazon, Phillips, Anker, Jambox, etc. I narrowed it down to those with speakerphone capability, thinking I'd satisfy that need along with the media speaker requirement. After a LOT of research and live auditions, I settled on Nyne Bass, and couldn't be happier with it -- as a media speaker - truly amazing in all respects: sound is stunningly good - even outdoors, and both battery life and bluetooth handling are excellent. Unfortunately, it's only mediocre when turning a phone into a speakerphone, and often quite disappointing -- and I've tried out colleague's products like Jambox for the same purpose, and also found them disappointing. So -- I went on the hunt for a \"real\" business quality Bluetooth speakerphone.After much research, I homed in on Jabra, and the 510+ looked most promising after reading a LOT of reviews. Buying via Amazon Prime, I knew I had no risk, so I place the order -- and had the package on my desk about 36 hours later. Once again -- kudos to Amazon Prime and the vendors that work with Amazon in this program.The product is perfectly packaged, and beautifully made. It appears to be about 4.5\" in diameter, and about 1.25\" high when sitting flat on a desk or table. It is a gorgeous, professional grade piece of tech with excellent fit and finish and features. It comes with a neoprene zipper case, the USB cord wraps around the body and tucks into a groove that also holds the cable end in place. Incredibly well thought out and executed.This model can be connected to a phone or laptop via bluetooth, and to a laptop via USB cable. It doesn't come with its own charging brick, but the USB cable can charge from any standard 1A or higher brick. It takes a while for a full charge, but once charged, I can use it all day and into the night, and the charge is only partially depleted.Sound quality is absolutely spectacular for the purpose. I can place this on a table or desk in a room with a dozen people at distances from 3 ft to 15 ft or more, and they are all picked up and easily understand by people at the other end of the call. What comes out of the speaker is superb as well: I'm often on the receiving end of a conference call with two dozen people, all different sound environments and volume levels, and half a dozen international accents -- and this speaker yields clear audio rivaling $400 or $500 Polycom and Cisco equipment (no exaggeration). This is so good, in fact, that I've taken to turning it on when sitting in my office at my current client's site, and using it in favor of the brand new Cisco equipment installed there. It's a better experience.The controls around the perimeter are all touch controls -- no physical buttons to degrade, and they work perfectly. Power, answer / hang up, volume up/down, bluetooth (on/off/pair), mute, battery (to check battery charge level). There are a serious of LEDs around the perimeter of the speaker that are almost invisible when off, but light up as needed to indicate function, e.g., Bluetooth connected, power on, volume level and battery life (number of lights on out of ten around the perimeter), etc. Audio prompts walk you through pairing, connection status, etc -- and these can be turned on and off via preferences.The firmware is easily upgradeable via the USB cable and downloadable PC application. I haven't had need to use the app yet, but it provides deeper control over options and connection to services like Lync. This also provides support for soft phones: this \"510+ MS edition\" is optimized for Microsoft products like Lync -- the other 510+ is, I believe, aimed more at other soft phone products like Cisco.All in all: a beautifully designed, engineered and implemented product. Every now and then you trip across a gem that defines state of the art in its category - and I believe this qualifies. As you might guess, I'm delighted with this product.\n","id":"aca2b246-c666-4563-93fc-aefbaf211fa4"},{"text":"\n  First the good: It's compact, lightweight, and the haptic buttons are responsive and intuitive.

The textbooks are large and heavy, but all she carries in the bag is two textbooks, a couple of notebooks, and a lab book. Within a few weeks the wheels began to sag. I examined the bag, and discovered that screws on both wheels had apparently fallen out. I replaced them with stainless steel screws, washers, and locking nuts. I had to disassemble one side in order to replace the screws, so I learned more than I wanted to know about the poor construction of this bag.

It takes just seconds and you are ready to go from backpack to rollers and back again. Very niceI have been using this to carry everything from groceries to a airplane carry on and so far it has performed excellent.  Very well made.CONS1.

I took them with a grain of salt and went ahead and purchased one of these DG60's for myself, it was a mistake. (For TL;DR skip to the bottom.)Pro:Sound quality over APTX HD is incredible and zero lip sync issues from latency (used Sony XM3's).Con:The volume automatically increases for no reason.You simply can NOT enjoy a video game or music while trying to voice chat over something like discord. It will force your bluetooth device into \"call\" mode, which makes all sounds harsh and very low quality. No other bluetooth transceiver I've used does this.The range is good, but if a person or animal goes in between your device and the transmitter it will drop or stutter.To trouble shoot these issues I tried every single USB port on my computer (that's 12 to be exact, ranging from USB 2.0 to USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt Gen 3). Tried different headphones and earbuds. Tried an add-in PCI X1 USB card with its own controller on board thinking it might be a USB controller issue since the motherboard shares USB ports with only a few controllers. Lastly tried a different computer altogether. NONE of this fixed the issues.This \"sound card\" is garbage and does not do what it promises. I suggest looking at the Creative Labs BT-W3. They're brand new to the market as of June 2020, so right now only place to get one is directly from Creative Labs themselves.

I have a number of USB devices that address this issue with AISO drivers or similar vendor provided software.  This solution has been around for years and expected on PC USB based sound cards, if you can’t support 48khz sample rate and 24 bit depth from the source PC you cannot claim (as per Avantree web site)  aptX HD compatibility. Period!.  What’s happening between the dongle and the headphones, or in my case the FIIO BTR5 is irrelevant.  It seems to me that the solution would have preceded product release and packaging that claims “Superior aptX HD sound” . Furthermore, the actual device has a switch to enable  Qualcomm HD codec performance which it can’t deliver due to the crippled USB interface (what is the maximum Bluetooth audio transmission bit rate of the DG60?) . Worse yet, the device defaults in Windows 10 to the DirectSound API that is seldom if ever used by modern quality audio devices.  I am not the first customer to bring this issue to Avantree's attention, and the “we are working on it” excuse seems to be the standard reply.When companies intentionally mislead their customers about a product’s capability it calls into question the claimed performance of all their products, and the integrity of the company’s business practices.

The rhymes on every song are extremely tight and there is nothing elementary about anything here. Lars has what most MCs out there now lack: brains. You'll listen to some lines over and over just to grasp the full hilarity of them. The highlight for me is the sublime \"Signing Emo\" which chronicles the rise and fall of fictional emo band Hearts That Hate, complete with a chorus by said band that is rife with more emo cliches than the entire Drive-Thru Records catalog. I almost split a gut the first time I heard it. Trust me on this, if you enjoy anything about music and can appreciate a rhyme of any kind you will not be dissapointed.

In probably his first major EP, MC Lars lays it out on the table in all his geeky/fun glory. Since it's independently produced, it is a bit rough and sounds like a demo. \"iGeneration\" and \"Signing Emo\" are later found on his semi-major label debut, and they mostly sound the same. Songs like \"Hurricane Fresh,\" \"UK Vise Versa\" and \"Straight Outta Stockholm\" are great indie rap, and entertaining to boot. \"Mr. Raven\" on the other hand is not only great indie rap, but an excellent rap track period. Dare I say it's MC Lars' best? Perfectly incorporating Edgar Allen Poe's famous poem, it kicks the beats, brings the cool, and MC Lars lays it down, scaring the crap out of all comers.

Also it came with an old style charger but I was able to use the USB-c port to charge as well. Also the USB-c is able to display 3840 4k to external via HDMI adapter. Occasionally my Logitech Bluetooth mouse acts crazy which may because touch screen - the problem goes away when I open the laptop slightly even on external display. The lid/touch display may be too thin, not sturdy enough compared to X1.\n","id":"5ea758cf-fdb8-481d-9070-de3792effdc8"},{"text":"\n  Love this thing amazing screen, amazing battery life, decent speed.Gonna update the SSD to a faster Samsung m.2.

Since they upgraded 6 months after the 2019, many reviews are not for the correct laptop.I received this laptop a few days ago and it is an amazing machine. I highly recommend it. I am a a fairly advanced tech geek, I build my desktop computers, my servers and I currently run 6 pro photography servers in a collocation bay in NYC.My gaming needs are mostly around running Oculus Rift S, Civilization 6, StarCraft 2 and few others.My pro needs are Adobe Creative Suite, Sketchup and CAD / 3D drawings manipulation (not creation) in Solidworks.PROS- matte black looks nice and definitely can be brought at a professional meeting with clients without looking like the weird gaming laptops- delivers performance as advertised : 8 cores i7-10875 with GeForce RTX 2080 Super are running really fast on 1TB Samsung M2 SSD (default hardware) and 16gb of RAM- running intense app will trigger all the fans, which are surprisingly not so loud- computer boots windows in 4 seconds with Windows Hello recognizing your face so fast, you don't even see the lock screen- Full size HDMI is a nice addition to the 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt ports, that ARE connected to the GeForce card and not to the Intel integrated graphics (Microsoft Surface Book biggest disappointment...). Great amount of inputs- battery is a good when non-gaming use (if setup properly - keep backlight simple, not razer chroma. Although do not expect the 10 hours of battery of the lighter computers, 8 cores will consume more, so if you need more battery life, then go with 4 or 6 cores.- I can run oculus rift S on battery at high graphics for over 2hrs so very happy- 4K touch OLED screen is stunning with thin bezels- Dolby Atmos sound is great and powerful but lacking a bit the bass...- black aluminum body is thin, and as light as it can be. 2 rubber bump-on underneath are elevating the laptop to make sure there is airflow from under and in the back.- keyboard is comfortable (nice size keys, including the shift) and fully customizable : assign Function keys to different programs or default actions- touch pad is similar to MacBook Pro : wide, comfortable, precise and no ghost touch- A/C adapter is large but slim, so it is quite easy to fit in a briefcase front pocket. I like the way razer protects their electrical wires with a synthetic fabric that protects it.- base cover can be easily removed to update RAM to 32GB or updated M2 SSD to 2TB- no crapware installed: good job, reallyCONS- I have some trust issues with Razer as they always look good on paper and products stop working after 1-3 year. I owned 1 keyboard that stopped working. I don't even know how it is possible for keys, which are clean and unobstructed, to not be responsive when pressed. I owned 4 mouses and 3 of them died after 1 to 3 years of use, with one that was swapped many times by razer support. Surprisingly the oldest one (2013 Orochi) is still working. All that too say that it is too early to say if the laptop will last 3 years at least.- in my opinion, the main issue is the base running warm all the time. Of course it gets hot when running hardcore graphics but I am talking normal web use, my palms are hot resting on the base and I found it a bit uncomfortable, but not a dealbreaker- thus, do not use this computer under a warm sun. Apart from the heat, it will not be easy to view the glossy screen and brightness won't go high enough. In defense of Razer, most glossy monitors will have the same issue, but black will get hot- which brings me to my next negative point : only the $4,300 version WITH Quadro RTX5000 is available in silver (called white on their website), why not offering the choice : black or silver? I would have definitely chosen the silver...- gaming or rendering 3D will definitely draw too much power to be used on a battery comfortably. So this is a laptop that should be plugged when running full power. That's the drawback of a thin laptop...- Windows 10 home installed... Really????!!!! At $3,299 You could not have included Win10 Pro????!!!!In conclusion : this laptop is a solid buy, unless battery life is more important than processing power. Even though, it is decent, i7 4 cores will draw much less and GeForce 1660 as well.\n","id":"04b5e93b-fd4c-4e05-88b1-ffa061597113"},{"text":"\n  I received my blade 3 days ago and when I update the bios it went to bsod then when I start it the screen is black with nothing I mean i payed 3000+ for this laptop and it goes like that the problem i live outside the state so I have to ship back which also cost me 300$ iam really upset with the quality of the laptop and I forgot to mention that the oled screen had a dead pixel all in all iam really exhausted from this laptop now I have to wait another 2 weak to get my money back\n","id":"8d62fcb3-c5fa-4085-a856-dc95c1f6dd22"},{"text":"\n  An excellent little laptop, but I got two small defects in a row. that's simply not acceptable when I'm paying this much money.

So far is blasting fast for everyday use and every game i've tried runs +30 FPS on the best settings. I've haven't been able to reach 300 FPS in any game so the 300Hz display is a bit of an overkill.The built quality is amazing, a bit sharp on the edges (I was used to a macbook) and feels sturdy.PROS:- It is a beast hiding on a very sober design. Besides the green logo on the back of the display, you wouldn't know its a gaming laptop, which is great if you plan using it on a formal workplace (which is my case).- The RGB keyboard is a great addition if you take the time to really configure the different lightning options for each app.CONS:- It gets HOT. I cannot use it on the bed/lap while playing any casual game (the temperature its ok/mildly unconfortable for browsing the internet though).- The proprietary charger port seems to be designed to be a tight fit which makes you feel you are scratching the aluminum (sometimes you are).- Speakers are bad, super bad. I didn't expect them to sound good, but they are not useful for anything else but conferencing.- Expensive, here you are paying for a simplistic gaming design, premium materials and awesome thermal performance on a thin laptop.Semi-CON:- The battery life is somewhere around 3 hours. Not bad for a gaming laptop, but for a mobile workstation means you will need to carry a charger wherever you go. I solved it by using a 100W USB C charger for moving around instead of the bulky 230W original charger, but you  wont be able to achieve peak performance this way.\n","id":"28d194d5-9e07-4227-9f5b-e66086f5cd53"},{"text":"\n  Absolutely, bar none, the best laptop for Windows 10 on the market.

It is a very round and thicc boi but so so so cute, I will keep using it at the cost of cramping up my hand.

The seller mentions in the posting that it is plug and play and it truly was for me! I plugged the USB in, my computer recognized it and let me know it was setting it up. 30 seconds later I was able to use the mouse.I am an adult and granted I do have smaller hands but I wouldn't say its a \"childrens mouse\". It is not any smaller than a regular computer mouse.I wouldn't say its any quieter in clicking sound than a standard mouse, but it is wireless, and WAY CUTER.I've only been using it for 30 minutes or so. I will update on battery life if I feel its skewed one way or another. I am also using rechargeable batteries so I don't know if that will affect it.Either way, if you're looking for a super cute and unique wireless mouse, this is it!\n","id":"d24719fe-4371-463e-9078-5a6765ce8488"},{"text":"\n  At first, I was really confused because there were no instructions and I couldn’t find the USB plug in. So I tried to see if maybe it connected via Bluetooth. When that didn’t work I looked everywhere in my room.Finally, I went to the seller to let them know I never received a USB plug in but found the answer in the Q&A. The USB is located in the battery slot, you just have to pull it out. Which is suuuuuper convenient because if I ever want to take it on the go or away from my computer I can keep them together.The mouse itself is just as described and as easy to use as a plain mouse. The clicking is not too loud but also not super quiet. The roller is a little stiff but I honestly prefer it that way.Overall, this is the perfect mouse. I’m not so sure about battery life yet since I just got it, but from experience with previous mice they tend to last a while.Edit: after two months of constant use the battery has yet to give me any problems. I haven’t had to change it yet and I ended up using it for work, so I use it a lot. I did notice, however, that after that much use the mouse started to turn yellow where my fingers lay most often. So I guess that’s something to look out for.\n","id":"c9656ee7-301f-44b9-8a7f-4966fc90c1d8"},{"text":"\n  When I bought this mouse I absolutely adored it. How could I not love an adorable pink hamster mouse???

Then it died. I've had the mouse for almost three months and it only takes one battery, so it made sense that it was time for a new battery. Put a new battery in and the mouse was still dead. I tried a few more batteries, tried turning it off and on, but it is very dead.I can't recommend a computer mouse that can't even survive for 3 months.\n","id":"867da40b-792a-45e8-8642-3e9bb0998c21"},{"text":"\n  I bought this mouse for my daughter (my hand pictured on the mouse).

It means Shingled Magnetic Recording, basically the data on the drive is written overlapped like shingles on a roof. This means you can get more data on each disk platter, hence less platters for a given size and thus the drive is cheaper. Ok that's great right? Well the problem is this DRASTICALLY slows down the write speed for long sequential writes. It can get bogged down during large writes and become very very slow, like 10MB/s on average slow. Reads are fine it is only writing that is affected.That being said, the SMR technology does make this drive one of the best for $s/TB on the market, just don't expect amazing performance from it.

I've been keeping a small fan on them as I've been copying and verifying for 24/7 for a few days. Probably not best to run 24/7 unless there's some cooling on them or they're in a very cold room. But I don't imagine most people will be running them at full tilt for days on end.I would buy these and take the drives out of their cases and put into a NAS. I'm curious how they'd perform long term.\n","id":"17721b85-03fc-4766-8dad-cffc20f70750"},{"text":"\n  I would definitely skip on this one. I received it in the mail bent in half which ended up damaging it. (Package clearly states at the top to not bend or fold.)  Regardless of the bending damage, the cover was much stiffer than I had hoped for and allowed for much more height than the actual keys which resulted in the cover not fitting well at all. You have to type much harder and even then some keys aren't as responsive due to the firm covering.

I am an adult using these stickers in letters so slight damage wouldn't have been an issue but had I known how bad it was, I would have just paid full price for a normal one.Anyways. I guess that's on me. All of the stickers in this book have doubles or triples which is kind of lame, and many of the stickers are useless fluff like collars or dog bowls.

I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.\n","id":"54a00db1-8bc2-4841-8cf2-90761df7da01"},{"text":"\n  I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.\n","id":"40b1a250-0b4f-454e-9078-c7aa5d0a6dba"},{"text":"\n  I returned this in frustration. The advertised \"Super Bright\" keyboard was NOT bright at all.  In a way, there is a bright backlight that peeks out from below the edges of the keys. Very little light makes it out through the letters on the keys. The keys are dim and unreadable. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.\n","id":"d6218e86-6463-4da6-876c-bd6e626106c5"},{"text":"\n  This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.\n","id":"9d91c17f-7486-4aca-aa0c-a10a3a2520fe"},{"text":"\n  As advertised and more: really useful, practical, durable, secure, protective, not bulky, very presentable.

He is mostly confined to a wheelchair at 63. He is also often cold due to his muscle disease. He has ALWAYS lived with pets since he was a toddler. 6 mos after our 17 1/2 yr old chow passed in spring of 2018 he asked if we could start looking for a small dog that could sit on his lap. We found Willie a 2 yro 13 1b  Rat Terrier being fostered fairly close by. It was a perfect match for us. As my husband's reflexes have slowed, Willie moves a little fast for him, this is OK in the house but not for moving around outside or short trips in the car (with my husband seat belted into our mobility van while the chair is locked down).  Added benefit is the warmth Willie in the backpack provides. In fact for summer I plan to put a couple small blue ice packs in the iPad pocket to keep Willie from overheating. The backpack fits my husband perfectly (5 ft 8 inches and 195 lb)  he usually wears XL. It may be a little tight for someone larger, IMO the max would be a small 2XL but it would definitely fit smaller people. Willie fits perfectly inside and the extra zipper to allow his head to pop out is fabulous. He snuggles in then lays his head on my husband's chest.  I feel comfortable as I can tether Willie into the backpack to prevent him jumping out when the whim arises. It's rare but does happen. My husband's hands are too weak to hang on to a leash if Willie really pulled. What secures him the best is COMFORT due to the hard poly (rubber like) floor, he can brace his feet. I have a sack I hang to the side and plop Willie in sometimes when I'm expecting a furnace tech, plumber or the like but he has to lay down (and does). The frontpack  allows Willie to adjust position.  And for my husband, it allows him to control Willie's movements easier.  Added plus, there is plenty of room for his Flexi Leash, other gear (phone, wallet, iPad, etc,  AND BOTH  small water bottle and soda bottle.  AND OF COURSE treats for both. I know Willie doesn't mind it, because when I get it out of the closet he starts jumping up and down to get on my husband's lap. I do not recommend it for routine travel in a vehicle as the deployment of the driver's side airbag could break Willie's neck. We are very cognizant of this and if we decide to take a short drive with Willie in the pack (to family within 3mi distance) my husband places his hands as a shield between Willie'e head and airbag. For longer distances we are training Willie with a Zugo. For those who are in a wheelchair it is tough to create systems which allow for independence. This backpack used as a front pack allows my husband to have some alone time with Willie outside for \"walks\" and or doggy shopping, etc. I've used Kurgo gear before and it has never failed me. My beloved Abigail who passed at 17 1/2 (very old for a chow) and she had severe osteoarthritis. She loved the lift I got from Kurgo. If she wanted to move from one level to another on our back sun porch she would bark and her handmaid (me) would put her lift on her and help up or down. It took ONCE for her to learn. It was easy for me to trust this product and it works.\n","id":"e73674f5-ad30-466a-9c7f-981abcc74d42"},{"text":"\n  Just received it in the mail. This is my initial observation: sturdy, well-made, and surprisingly well-designed in some little details. We live in a city with comprehensive public transportation system, and our dog loves to travel by subway or train to various places (e.g., park) on a weekly basis. It has been unbelievably difficult to find a carrier of any kind with ergonomic designs for humans, then we stumbled upon G-Train announcement.A few things I’m impressed by G-Train:1) the soft-shell-like bottom under the pet compartment is a better design than any of the carriers I’ve seen/researched on.2) the storage compartment is generous, we won’t have to pack another bag for short trips anymore!3) thickness of the straps for weight distribution.Things I wish could be improved:1) the removable pad inside the pet compartment contains a thick cardboard, instead of plastic-like material. This means it’d be hard to clean once it gets wet. It also makes placing an ice pack in there in summertime difficult.2) the “laptop sleeve” is smaller than I expected. Its size is better suited for a decent sized tablet than laptop. It ought to be advertised as such.Will update this review if anything changes. Hopefully it doesn’t wear out fast.Overall verdict by our pup: refusing to leave G-Train after a test drive.\n","id":"080f0af5-21ad-447c-b1d7-b45324aecd40"},{"text":"\n  My dog loves it!!!

(4) The connectors all have reasonable-looking stress reliefs on the cables, so they shouldn't be too fragile.Downsides: (1) When used with my cell phone -- an LG Tracfone, admittedly not particularly high end, but perfectly functional for day-to-day use -- the sound from the headphones was good, but people who I talked to said that my voice sounded very tinny, similar to what you'd expect in a military aircraft or vehicle intercom - probably an impedance or preamp issue between the phone circuit and the microphone in the headset.  (2) If you were playing video games and/or demand super sound performance, these are definitely not for you -- they're inexpensive, functional headphones, not a set of Bose or Sennheiser wonderphones. (3) If you have a double connector coming out of your computer, cell phone, tablet or whatever device you're going to be using the headset with, you'll have to use the included cable splitter -- not a big deal, since it comes with the headset and it's free, but it's another thing to clutter up your workspace.I've only been using the headset for a few days, and essentially all my usage has been for Skype phone calls with my Lenovo laptop.  I purchased a right angle cable extender (with 8\" cable) to allow me to plug in/out the headset without overworking the 3.5 mm single connector on my laptop -- I figured it would be a lot less hassle in the event of a future busted jack to replace the extender than it would be to deal with a broken connector on the motherboard... which can happen if you plug in/out more than a few thousand times.Overall, it seems like a very good buy -- now we'll have to see how long the headset lasts under the few-times daily use that I'll put it to.\n","id":"68c2955f-a106-4f0e-9c46-c6d38df3d550"},{"text":"\n  This is the third one I've bought in the last 6 months.

I bought this one because it supposedly showcased its sturdiness, it extended to a good height for a singer who is tall and had a solid back. I would like to use this during performances and I think the ones with holes look silly on stage for singers at leastProseasy to assemblelooks niceCons- the knobs to put it together wrecked my hands trying to get them tight enough for this to be sturdy- stand is not sturdy at all- stand wobbles,  and the portion to hold music is easily bent. Stand wobbles less the shorter it goes, but I am tall and sing so I can't be looking too far down each time. Also the only way this gets to 57 inches is if it is at it's max lines on the poles and the book portion is completely upright. The photo in the description is completely wrong- I tried to put my music on it and the stand just swayed back and forth, gently tried my laptop the same thing. I barely trust it for music let alone my laptop- the free gift is the worst music book I've ever seen, why even include it in all honesty. It doesn't close and really doesn't stay open either. because it's free I shouldn't be so hard on this folder but I'm pretty irritated at everything included in this package\n","id":"2a8caa00-84c8-49a4-859c-61fdf5a24402"},{"text":"\n  I play guitar and write songs as a hobby, and I could never figure out a good way to display my music so that I could see it while I play!

It features two metal \"arms\" that hold the music in place on the stand, but those \"arms\" can be rotated out of the way if I don't want to use them. The stand came with a carrying case and a notebook with page protectors, all ready for music to be added.

But it does adjust so it's tall enough that the picture fills the entire screen.  I wouldn't recommend using it this way in a \"professional\" environment with lots of people moving around it, as it's kind of slightly unsteady because it's top-heavy with the projector on top of the light stand.

I was searching a long time for one in both stores and online. The ones I found at the Apple store and BestBuy did not fit my requirements. If they were slim, they didn't have a handle. If they had a handle, they were way too bulky. I had initially ordered the 13-13.3\" sleeve which I found way too big. I should have payed attention to the measurements listed. It had so much space around my laptop so I returned it and ordered the smaller 11\" sleeve. This one fits perfectly. I don't know why the sizes are listed the way they are here but please measure your laptop prior to purchasing the sleeve; look at the inside measurements of the sleeves specifically. I would presume the 13-13.3\" sleeve would actually fit a 15\" MacBook. As far as the bag itself, I just received it so I cannot say anything about durability. It does however look very protective as it has thick padding on either side with a very soft material inside; the padding feels like memory foam. The quality is great too; bags of the same quality sell for at least 3x more in other places.

If you want to pay a little more I would go with the C920.  I wasn't paying and I had to keep the cost down.  It was truly plug and play, the Logitech drivers popped up and started installing.  It was very quick and simple.  I do wish that most of these companies would quit letting Bing and all that be apart of the installation process where you have to pay attention to uncheck the boxes during installation, however thats neither here nor there for this review.  Once the cam was up there is a \"Follow my face\" feature which could definitely be handy and works surprisingly well.  The picture quality is very good and the sound/mic is excellent.  I really was shocked at how easy setup was and at the quality at this pricing point.  If your looking for a very good cam with a good mic at a low price, you cant go wrong with this thing.The only reason it got 4 stars was because of the cord length.  I know that seems silly and stupid, but its ridiculously short.  If your using it on  desktop like me, then its a huge issue, I actually had to move my PC up onto my desk because of this cam.  The cord is extremely short, so to use it on my monitor as it should be, is more tricky.  If they would have put a normal size cord, I would have given it 5 stars, maybe they were only thinking of people that use laptops.  I am that person most of the time, just not for work.  It is very compatible with Skype, Skype picked it all up very quickly and has since worked flawlessly.  I keep this cam on for almost 9-10 hours 5 days a week and I have yet to have an issue with this cam now for a couple weeks.  The other side says I am very clear and sound very clear, they are using the same cam, especially compared to what we were us ing.Boxing was what I have come to expect with Logitech.  Very nice, secure, and simple manuals.  If my review was helpful to you, please click yes below.\n","id":"61ebc1d1-019e-4484-ade9-34f7d32160c8"},{"text":"\n   I absolute love this Webcam!Easy to use. The only downside on this webcam is that the cable is extremely short.

It has some good features such as motion recording, and face tracking.* 1080P (I'm not sure if it is true 1080P, but it still looks great). Sample of 1080P (I recorded the video review in 720P to showcase features): https://vid.me/Rjn6* The mount lets you mount to your monitor bezel, or laptop, and 360 degree rotation around said mount.* Microphone is actually not that terrible. You may want to learn to how extract the audio track though, and clean up the audio using something like audacity.Cons:* Using 1080P limits the features in the Logitech recording software such as face tracking, and maybe other things. Why? I have no idea.Overall I really like this webcam for the quality, price, and form factor.\n","id":"dfee7140-612f-4677-872e-a187d30ba43a"},{"text":"\n  Received webcam today and installed it. I was not happy at all with the quality of the images or videos. I have gotten better photos from 2mp camera phones. I have an earlier Logitech webcam (C510) that takes much better pics.

However, I am sure sure if it was me or just luck. I'm planning a trip through Italy and have been there a couple of times before. However, I needed a new day pack and looking into a Pacsafe, but I have used North Face packs previously. I was debating between two models from Pacsafe, the LS350 and 350GII. I ended up with the LS350 because I like the layout of the interior pockets. The LS350 has pockets in the outside opening, and pockets it the main pack area. However, the number and layout seemed better. The RFID pocket which protects the computer chips on credit cards and passports is in the main pack area and that seemed even more secure because it can be actually double locked with the Pacsafe and a small cable lock.If you have not read about this companies packs they are lined with a metal mesh so someone can't cut through with a razor blade, the straps have a light metal cable so they can't be cut, the zippers have a type of closure that makes it difficult to unlock if someone is behind you, and finally the one strap has a unique closure that allows it to be secured around a chair so if you are eating someone can't walk off with your pack. I did take some pictures.I tried it out on a short week trip and loaded it with a ton of stuff and it weighed exactly 15 pounds. It was comfortable and the straps worked well. I carried it thought the Denver airport from gate 1 to 93! It was like most any other pack but I am very used to carrying packs. This one does have a neoprene padding against your back, so I was not poked with anything inside. It easily carried my iPad and also a netbook. A file of paperwork, and of course goodies. The 15L can fill up fast but this is a day pack so keep that in mind.The interior of the tan one I have is a lighter color material making it easier to find things. The pack is not really \"expandable\" I think due to the mesh material. However, the interior seems to have some padding. I think it will be great for those daytrips where you need some basic items.Photos show the closure on strap to secure around a chair, the unique \"lock\" for the outside zipper, closure for main zipper which can be secured with an actual lock, the outer pockets, and interior pocket with RFID protection for chips on credit cards.I think for the hopeful peace of mind in traveling through various countries, this may offer some comfort. Comes in several colors but I got the sandstone (tan) because everyone has black. This would be easier to spot and not forgotten.\n","id":"b8ef6785-04e9-4498-9ea1-dfefd1f40e94"},{"text":"\n  I was looking for a backpack for an international trip to serve as a carry-on/purse and also carry items on day trips while traveling. I took a representative set of items I usually carry: planer, Canon camera, extra lens, battery charger, wallet, Kindle, pens, water bottle, baby wipes, lip stick/lip balm; and tried them in several different backpacks. The MetroSafe LS350 was my winner. I appreciated the security features like zipper hooks/locks and high quality YKK zippers. I liked that there was a way to keep the adjustable shoulder straps out of the way instead of just having them dangle down. I was able to fit everything I wanted and, when I was repacking it just to be sure, I was able to fit a light jacket, a snack, and some papers inside too. It was definitely full, but still light enough to carry, slim enough to slide under a seat, and had a low-profile look that didn't scream \"I'm a backpacker/tourist!\"\n","id":"ab0a6208-e922-435c-9f5d-ba9d17d5f96f"},{"text":"\n  I love the bag because of the size, color, and has lots of pockets.

I was looking for a very long arm so it would fit across my living room chair. The arm is actually only 16 inches. The remaining length is the laptop tray which doesn't really aid in extension if you mount it to your side. However I am going to tinker with it so it works because the product is so well built.This laptop arm is very heavy and very sturdy. It will likely outlive your computer AND your desk. It really does need to be mounter on something at least an inch thick and equally as sturdy. I think it maybe heavy enough to actually damage and break fiberboard.The instructions are only pictures so though it is very easy to put together, you may need help if you have never assembled anything before. There are no rubber or felt pads on the clamp screws and this may mar furniture when tightly screwed.The unit went together easily in about 15 minutes. Everything was well machined and lined up perfectly. Nothing feels loose or shoddy.  The enclosed key-wrench is used for assembly of the clamp/post and tightening of all the joints to your preference. Rubber feet and velcro are included to create a nonslip surface for your laptop. The arm will swing 360 degrees and includes clips to keep wires out of the way. All the joints were tight enough on arrival. We haven't needed to adjust them. The arm only articulates laterally and can only be lowered to about 1\" above table height. The base of the pole is as low as the arm can go.Compared to all the other wiggly, jiggly and shaky laptop stands/desks I've read about, this one is awell constructed gem.

The arms are already put together and you just need to slide them onto the mount pole and tighten them. When I first mounted my screen the weight of it would pull the adjustable hinge down but after I tightened the crap out of the bolt there it holds nicely.The second worry that I had was that with the large screen my laptop and monitor would overlap. Wrong again. There is plenty of room and with the range of motion with the arms I can either have them side by side or pull the larger screen forward to play games or watch movies. You can also rotate the monitor mount on the fly for either landscape or portrait.The mounts also include small cable clips which help with wire management. One of these clips broke right away (my fault) but they provide extra in the small bag of screws and such.All in all this is a very versatile and sturdy mount.

They are: The surface is SOO slippery, everything slides off it, even when it is in 'flat' mode. We had to stick rug grip material to it, so I could use it. Would for sure have returned it, but I needed it asap after surgery. The wheels when attached make it quite high and may or may not fit under a sofa. It only fitted under one of ours and we still took the wheels off because there is NO 'WHEEL LOCK MECHANISM'' so its definitely does roll around unless its on a rug.If you have a high bed, such as we do, its fine for use as a side table next to it, but didn't fit comfortably over our bed. So, all in all looks great, but consumers need to be aware and personally, I would have opted for something else, had I known.\n","id":"e0de9f86-cd07-4fdc-b570-71e4467c83d2"},{"text":"\n  Perfect size, the split-tilt works great, the low-profile wheels fit under my couch and it extends high enough to work in bed.

It looks good enough for faux wood grain, though I'd prefer real wood, and it is impervious to spills and glass rings. My complaint is that it is sooooo slippery. Slippery enough that if set my laptop on it while tilted, and don't prop the laptop against the lip it will start sliding enough to jump the lip and fall off the stand... not good.

Excellent microphone for the price!\n","id":"de13f5f3-c7da-4652-8c4c-aface14b90b1"},{"text":"\n  I was skeptical of this mic despite the glowing reviews - even the limited reviews on youtube are good, with most finding that the limitations of the microphone are far fewer than it's benefit - which, frankly, is it's price.  I picked it up for $24 dollars on a flash sale, but it's well worth the normal price for how it sounds.I picked it up with the Neewer NB-35 Microphone boom arm (which is PERFECT for this microphone, btw and comes with a pop filter!)  Less than 50 bucks for a complete usb microphone setup.  That alone is pretty great.Less than a week after buying this, however, I was at bestbuy for a big sale, and saw that the Blackout edition Blue Yeti was on sale with the ghost recon wildlands game combo for a shocking $75 dollars.  So I bought it.I'm a singer/songwriter with 20+ years of recording behind me and play PC games and do some streaming and needed a new mic.All day I've been testing this mic (I have the black Fifine K669B for the record)  and the Yeti side by side.  The Yeti is larger, feels more premium, and has a mute button, gain control adjusts to louder volume, has 4 different polarity settings for doing podcasts or recording in stereo among other things.  But I tested this side by side with the Yeti using the Yeti's cardioid settings to match the Fifine's.  I adjusted the gain controls to be the same in windows, and slightly higher on the Fifine's gain knob to match the Yeti so they were as evenly matched as possible.I cannot distinguish a large enough difference in the audio (flat recorded in mono with audacity)  to truly be able to justify the already discounted price of the Yeti compared side by side with the Fifine.Yes, the audio is just that good.  I mean, as good as a USB mic is going to be.  If you have the extra scratch and need more than one polarity pattern than just right in front of the mic (and the sides) then you cannot go wrong with the Fifine.  I was so taken aback after hearing such good things about the yeti, but they both pickup the same background noises, and feel very similar.  When positioned about 6\" from the mics with pop filters in place, my voice felt more natural coming from the Fifine, with a bit more clarity perhaps in the Yeti but barely noticable.  What bassiness there was (my voice isn't very bassy) was - to my ears - better on the Fifine.  Not like, stupid bassy, but naturally the tone sounded more pleasing.  And that's where this mic will be, about 6\" from my face.  It's small, light, very well made, all-metal, and about 1/4th the size of the Yeti.  And the yeti weighs A TON, and has some bizarre irregular threading on the mount part where you need to buy a specific adapter or pray that you get one that the threads like.  The Fifine just works.  And if something happens to it you just buy another one for 25 bucks and call it a day.For professional streamers or people looking for a pro-level mic for doing voice/singing work, neither mic is going to be worth your time, you're going to want to use an interface and XLR mic/s for that, to get the sound as good as it can be.  But if you're laying down tracks, writing idea songs, playing around, gaming, streaming, chatting with your friends in discord, this mic is an incredible value.  I wish it had a mute button, that's a downer.  But you can just turn the gain all the way down.I don't work for Fifine or Neewer, and I really want to like the Yeti, but I'll probably return it in the morning.  It's a beautiful mic, but not as beautiful as having 50 bucks and something that sounds just as good. (IN CARDIOID MODE that is.)  Also the Yeti is bigger, heavier, and takes up more space. I thought for sure when I started testing them that the Yeti was going to blow my mind, but insanely I can NOT tell the difference, or rather, I cannot detect why anyone would believe the Yeti is better sounding.I feel that maybe it's a reputation thing, as with the Beats headphones.  Beats aren't all that good, my daughter has a pair and when I listen to them they're not bad but sound about as good as a pair of Klipsch I paid 30 bucks for on sale.  Same situation here.  I think Yeti's are maybe for people who either need that headphone passthrough, plan to use this for something greater than streaming or talking, and kids who just think they're good because other kids use them.TLDR: Don't be fooled, trust your ears, and just get this microphone and try it for yourself.  You've got very little to lose.\n","id":"94edd741-b38e-41e6-b5ff-d796735e1d56"},{"text":"\n  My review is a bit unconventional for this product as this microphone mostly seems to be used for creating music, and I'm not a musician; I'm just a gamer who hates having to wear those uncomfortable gaming headsets during raid.

After trying multiple mics that either didn't pick up my voice clearly enough, picked up everything around me except my voice, or picked up nothing at all, I came across this gem of a microphone that fits the bill in all aspects. I think the best part about this microphone for me is that I don't have to have it directly in front of my face to be heard loud and clear. In fact, I keep it pushed back against the wall near my monitor which is a good arm's length away. Though I use a push-to-talk VoIP program, my guild mates have said they don't hear any background noise around me when I hold the button down, and I  don't come in sounding garbled, too distant, or too loud.

It's not a very demanding game but it runs amazingAfter playing a while it doesn't get overly hot but the fans at full blast is kind of loud but no as loud as other laptops i have gamed on.Overall I think for the price 1599 it's a steal,  everything you would want in a powerhouse gaming laptop without the RGB overload,  in fact it looks almost too plain.Here are my at a glance scoresPerformance: 10/10 Everything I have thrown at it is over  144fpsScreen 10/10 The colors are bright,  refresh is fast and no bleedingAudio 6/10 not the greatest above average with other laptopsNoise 6/10 It's loud as a gaming laptop normally is but you don't need headphonesKeyboard 9/10 despite no single key led colors on the keys ... the spacing is perfect and it feels rock solidbuild and materials 8/10 solid overall though nothing stands outTrackpad 7/10 as good as any i've used but i wont be using it, everif you want amazing performance in a not so thin and light laptop I don't think you can do better.It's got room for expansion.When it comes to gaming,  FPS is very important to me and this laptop doles out performance in spades,  I feel comfortable that it will run games at high FPS for some time.I cannot recommend this laptop enough.\n","id":"341055ca-b1de-49d5-a215-a57bd223a772"},{"text":"\n  Absolutely love this laptop. I was looking for a performance oriented 15\" gaming laptop and sadly most brands for the past few years have been focusing on battery power and \"thin & light\" aspects.Everytime I looked at a gaming laptop model, it either looked like an edgy teenager designed it and/or it made so many compromises just to keep the overall thinness and weight of the laptop to a minimum.I'm an thinkpad fan (older models, at least), I dont like any of this 'more is less' mentality and with this laptop I feel right at home.Pros;1. The GPU is a 2070 Super. Most laptops GPUs in this price range not only are the non SUPER version but they're also almost always the MAX-Q version which is a weaker, more constrained version2. Keyboard feels excellent3. Design is sleek and doesn't look like a spaceship (except for maybe the back vents)4. Software allows control of the fans which allows you to set an agressive fan curve for better thermals or quiet for office work5. Software also allows GPU overclocking and CPU can be undervolted with Throttlestop6. No Sager bloatware7. Very good temps, no CPU or GPU throttling8. Excellent upgradeability: 1x 2.5\" SATA port, 2x M.2 SSD ports, 2x RAM slots9. Indicator lights for power, battery, caps/scroll/num lock and even HDD/SDD activity!10. Matte 144hz displayCons:1. Noticeable coil whine noise under certain circumstances2. No thunderbolt 3 and no displayport ports3. Although fan speed control allows for very quiet fans, it only lets you set fans at 20% minimum, you can't turn them off completely4. Fan speed control software doesnt remember last active profile for each of the performance profiles whenever you switch. So if you have a custom fan curve, if you go from performance to quiet, you have to select the custom fan curve again.5. Bottom cover has a lot of plastic clips you need to remove without breaking in order to upgrade any parts6. Keyboard has a numpad. This is subjective, but I'd prefer a non-numpad keyboard so that I dont have to place my hand off-centre whenever I typeThe battery, is smaller in size due to the very welcomed 2.5\" SATA port, this, combined with the fact that the components on this laptops aren't downclocked to consume less power gives you a very low battery time which is to be expected.I got around 2h of battery time while writing and compiling some code and connected to the WiFi + mid-brightness setting for the screen.Also, something that surprised me was that when I turned on a bluetooth mouse next to the laptop, it just prompted me if I wanted to connect to it instantly, didn't even have to pair it. Is this NFC ? I dont know.In conclusion, while most other manufacturers are obsessed with soldering components, making them non-upgradeable, constraining performance and thermals to make them more thin, light and have more battery life, Sager and Clevo focuses on what matters to users like me, performance, thermals, upgradeability, ports, did I mention this laptop even has an HDD/SSD indicator light!If these things sound exciting to you, then I wholeheartedly recommend you take a look at this and other Sager models.I only wish I could find out how I could purchase an extended warranty.I will definitely be looking closely at what else Sager has to offer next time I want to buy another laptop.\n","id":"347c053f-53b6-4de2-9c25-021a0c64574a"},{"text":"\n  I was replacing a high end desktop because I was downsizing. I knew I wouldn't get the same power out of a laptop, but a whole desktop set up just wasn't in the cards right now. Sager stood out immediately as the best bang for your buck. We're talking a couple hundred dollars cheaper than the competition, same quality.I've mostly used this with a tv and keyboard mouse, so I can't go into too much detail on the screen, but this laptop is solid for 1080p gaming at 60fps. Fan does get loud though. Surprisingly so. That's cooling for a laptop though. If you're in the market for a gaming laptop, I highly recommend Sager, even if you opt for a different configuration. About 7 months ago I was also in the market for a gaming laptop and they came out on top during my research then too.Edit: losing a star, the GPU fan makes a clicking sound often times. Occasionally I can get it to stop but it always comes back. It's also difficult to understate just how loud the fans on this thing are when it's going full speed. It's actually difficult to watch anything that requires transcoding because the fans get so loud it can be difficult to hear without a substantial volume boost.\n","id":"e975c76e-491a-4b8b-bef0-fe3f46a89cd0"},{"text":"\n  Extremely gaming capabilities! I bought this laptop after comparing hundreds of gaming laptops. This is the best 2070s gaming laptop you can ever had in 15k. It runs COD warzone all high in 120fps average.

The weight is also acceptable.\n","id":"2cb38b45-231c-4968-a5e1-9e164d6b6163"},{"text":"\n  Let me start this review by saying this was the second set of headphones we had ordered for our daughter. I wish we had gone with this seller/product from the beginning because it was definitely worth every penny!Right out of the box I could tell how well this headset was made. There is plenty of padding on the ear pieces and theyre made to hold up well. The volume was easy to control and didn't go up too loud so I didn't have to worry about her hurting herself when listening to music or books at school or in her room. The sizing was very easy to adjust, as well as them being foldable to easily store in her backpack for school.This is a Bluetooth headset, but is shipped with a cord that was approximately 4-5 ft long (it's not in front of me at the moment, but it's very long), so there is plenty of cord there for you. Its also shipped with a usb cable.The seller was also very helpful. They contacted me the day I was supposed to get the product (Amazon was behind by a day for some reason), and told me they would find out why and when I would get the product. I would HIGHLY recommend this seller and these headphones if your looking for a headset for your child, you will NOT be disappointed.Included several pics of the product at all angles to be as helpful as possible, as well as a pic of a happy 6 year old kitty cat lol\n","id":"852846ae-b0b0-4031-9f71-123019bb21f7"},{"text":"\n  It’s frigid outside today. I’m making the most of my morning with some classical music playing on my Alexa, a hot cup of coffee, and snuggling on the couch with my two year old. If you’ve ever had a two year old you understand what a feat this is to accomplish. They never sit still. They are never quiet. This is doubly true for my EXTRA wild child.Then we bought these headphones. She will sit quietly for at least 30 minutes at a time with these babies on. The best part, in my opinion, is that I don’t have to listen to Blippi or Peppa Pig anymore.  They fit my barely two year old and my six year old well. My 2 year old watches her iPad for one or two hours a day with them and we can go a little over a week between charges. I like that they are noise limiting so I don’t have to worry about them damaging their ear drums by turning the volume too loud.If you are a parent that is going to lose it if you hear Blippi sing ‘the excavator song’ one more time, I highly recommend buying a pair of these.\n","id":"04a59250-d83c-4fe5-b9b2-be67db111f93"},{"text":"\n  I purchased these for my daughter's 3rd b-day. She loved them! The headphones are so comfortable, she even falls asleep with them on. I picked this headset because the feature of having a cap on the volume to protect her ears and the option of using them with aux cable if you forget to charge them. I was very surprised at how sturdy they are. They have been thrown, stomped on, and been in a tug of war battles. I'd say they are toddler proof. Also super easy to pair with any Bluetooth device. We get a lot of compliments out running errands on how cute they are. Just a little tip: charge these up before gifting them if possible. Small children aren't very patient.\n","id":"4efcff5d-cc89-4544-bb33-794a7e37198f"},{"text":"\n  I wanted to get my kid a set of headphones but I was really worried about the volume being turned up and doing some damage to the hearing. I also wanted Bluetooth because it is convenient and it is 2019. These fit my requirements and then some. The sound is loud enough to hear in noisy environments but limited so that it isn't causing any damage to the kiddos ears. The Bluetooth works as expected. They feel very nice to the ear physically and no complaints from kiddo so far. The color is cute but I do wish they had a pink one being the favorite color right now. The lights are awesome and are irresistible, the lights have to be on at all times it seems. I really don't know how much additional drain the lights put on the battery but I know that it keeps going longer than she uses it because she has never lost power while using them. Great product, the kid loves them and we think they are really cute.\n","id":"90a80479-7bbf-4c12-8f3b-aa872b395bbf"},{"text":"\n  I was surprised in the review no one said there was an aux cord it too so you don’t have to charge it for Bluetooth use.

It's a beautiful bag when it arrives, looks very professional (she got lots of compliments), but my wife is upset because the brown coloring is fading in places from rubbing, and will come off instantly if scratched showing a black color underneath it.  I cannot return it at this point, but would if I could.  I can only speak for the brown color, I do not know if this is an issue in the black color.Having said this, the bag is sturdy and very roomy, tons of space for a laptop, office supplies, papers, notebooks, binders, water bottles or whatever.  She recently went to New Orleans and used the bag as her carry on (must detach the metal frame) and it worked perfectly.  Again giving her plenty of storage.  Zippers are high quality, leather seems to quality as well, my only concern here is the premature fading of the finish.  I suspect her bag will look very used and much older than it really is a year from now.  Good luck.\n","id":"1aefd922-00a3-4fa6-af47-daffb1868c94"},{"text":"\n  Researched a lot of different cases . . . had the Solo leather laptop case, which was great but my paperwork was more than the case could handle so had to get something a little bigger without being obnoxious.  This one had the right dimensions and had the appropriate # of compartments and the flexibility to take off the wheels.  The only observation so far. . the cow hide leather is not as aesthetically pleasing as I thought it would be.  It has an artificial leather appearance to it.  Some prior concerns talked about the color scratching off easily but this definitely has not been an issue.

It can be compact enough to remove from wheel base and hold over your shoulder with files and a laptop - or expand to fit a laptop, a tablet, several files, chargers, gadgets, and gizmos - or a laptop, a few files, and an outfit and shoes.  The wheels are solid - and have had their abuse.  It fits in the overhead bin on flights.  The only trouble I have had is that I sometimes press the button that allows the handle to go down into the case by accident.  But VERY RARELY.

My picture includes a regular laptop as a test for my setup, the tray support clips can be expanded to fit any laptop size. I like that it also has stopper hooks in the bottom of the tray  to further support the weight of the laptop. Please note, this is only the \"tray\". You need to have your own clamp stick and arm extender to use with the tray. You also need the plate that comes with your arm extender to connect it to this tray. The tray only comes with screws to connect your own visa plate (which comes with clamp mount arm) with the tray. The tray can be adjusted to support your preferred angle of the laptop.

Very easy to install and works well with other VIVO products.  The only downside, and hence 4 rather than five star, is that when you have one of the dual arm VIVO monitor products, where the two arms are the same height and cannot be adjusted independently, the laptop will sit too high compared to the other monitor.  But if you wanted to mount two laptops they would be the same height.  Right now I just have this mount sitting on the desktop like a wedge with the other monitor mounted in the Vivo dual arm (other arm empty).

I am a video game streamer and until I move out, I am mainly on my bed with my laptop. I bought this because my current setup doesn't have room for the mic I just bought and my mouse, the cup holder was a plus. When it came in I realized I will need to set up my laptop on the right because of the cup placement, but I'm right handed so now I am either going to have to not use the cup holder, or somehow manage to navigate a mouse with my left hand lol. Also my laptop is 15 inches wide for anyone wondering. Another flaw of the cup being on the left is that my fan is there too, so after an hour everything on the left will be hot from my laptop venting directly onto it. My ice coffee is now soup lol. I will probably just end up not using the holder, and it was my mistake not noticing these things when ordering, but oh well. Also, not sure if this will be the case for every bed, but I have a memory foam cover on mine and this thing is so tall it makes it VERY unstable.

Shirley's voice is rich, nimble, and well-recorded. She didn't lose that much of her vocal instrument as she got older, but on this album, there's a great controlled energy to her singing. She's a little hungry here, at a something of a low point in her career...she has something to prove, and she proves it. For example, she hits a level of vocal intensity on the swelling section of \"Why Did I Choose You\" that she rarely used at any time of her career.2.) Shirley has a fantastic rhythm section. No slight intended towards Charles Ables and Steve Williams, who made up the other  2/3 of her working trio for most of her later years, but Buster Williams and Billy Hart were 1st-rank jazz players who provide a lot of tasteful spark.As you might guess, a couple of the tunes are pretty slight. Peggy Lee's \"Take a Little Time to Smile\" is charming, but not terribly original. It's the kind of tune that Blossom Dearie could possibly fool you into thinking it was a great song, but it's...not a great song. Still, Shirley's performance of it is enjoyable, even if it doesn't make much of an impact. \"Gra'ma's Hands\" by Bill Withers is another that succeeds mostly on the basis of Shirley and the band's expert and subtle delivery--the song itself isn't much. And the 10-minute long instrumental take on the Luiz Bonfa bossa nova \"The Gentle Rain\" is pleasant, but leaves me wishing she had recorded three concise vocal numbers in its place. There's about 3/4  of a great album here, and that's enough to justify getting it.It's not terribly surprising that it took another decade for her career to catch fire, as 1978 was just a hard time to be a jazz musician of any stripe (other than perhaps a member of Weather Report). Shirley also had a small handful of great records between this one and and her 1988 Verve debut, \"I Thought About You,\" including three more on the Steeplechase label, and the fantastic \"Softly\" on the Audiophile label.I wouldn't recommend this album as the place to begin with Shirley Horn. For me, 1989's \"Close Enough for Love\" is the pinnacle of her studio work and a great place to start, and \"I Love You Paris\", recorded in 1992, is a sublime example of her live work. Both of those records have a stronger selection of material, great production and sound, and top-notch performances. But I would say \"A Lazy Afternoon\" is in the top ten of her discography, and it has a special vibe about it.\n","id":"dc3769ee-b398-41c9-8ba6-56ed9e97833d"},{"text":"\n  Apparently, this very album was the first after 10 years of no-recording. AND in fact her recording debut as a self-accompanying singer, as we know her all now.It displayed her mature style and versatility (she swings, soars and entrances). On the strength of this album Shirley Horn began to receive invitations to tour, which resulted in the succesful career when, 9 years later, Verve Music signed her and she finally started a full-time performer life.My favourite tracks here are \"Why Did I Choose You?\" (a typically powerful  Horn interpretation), the title track, and \"New York's My Home\".While I was so glad to find she recorded the great Brazilian standard \"Gentle rain\", it's eventually no real disillusion that she doesn't sing this one; her instrumental rendition gives us no less than 10 minutes of atmosphere!(4 stars for a Shirley Horn album, 5 stars for a jazz album)\n","id":"46d70846-54fd-488d-bdf8-791b5f11cfb2"},{"text":"\n  Great size.

If you can't decide which to buy, do yourself a favor and buy the Prime model. The Pro units aren't stable at all. They run much hotter, and once running for a couple hours, have actually less range than the Prime model. It's appears they overheat and become unstable.There is also extreme digital noise in the signal on the Pro models. Once the unit warms up, video sync is wildly unstable, especially when running the unit through a receiver or media player, such as a Roku. I have to power cycle the units very frequently and there is no way to lock down the resolution mode so you'll have long delays when using with a 720P display, as the receiver wants to stay in 1080 mode far too long. I tested interference significantly. These units were taken up to the mountains where there is NO interference on the 5.15~5.85GHz frequency in which these devices operate. No microwaves, no telephones, no nearby cellphones, wifi, etc. Again, the Prime model outperformed the Pro model by far when obstructions, such as walls, were present. It's worth noting that the Prime model actually has a wider frequency range available: 4.9~5.9GHz.As an important note, these devices work best with an actual computer. Running media devices, receivers, dvd players, etc. are not stable with the transmitter.As a technical FYI: The receiver requires 2A @ 5V power supply (included)  and the transmitter requires 1A @ 5V power supply (not included). The devices supports PCM, DTS, and DD5.1 audio formats. The devices supports the following video formats: TV: 1080p, 1080i,720p, 576p, 480p PC : 1920x1080, 1280x1024, 1024x768, 800x600, 640x480.\n","id":"6583b372-cca9-4bee-ba40-60ad6d338fd4"},{"text":"\n  We needed a good reliable device to share presentations and allow for Clients to share their screens in our conference room. We originally were given a BARCO NV to test by a local vendor - although the BARCO is a great device the price point was rather high. We researched and found this for almost 1/6 of the price. The set up was easy - literally plug in the main unit to power and the TV and the dongle to our device. It is a bit of adapter hell as we work on MS Surfaces and ultrabooks which don't have HDMI ports - we had to purchase a variety of adapters (display port to HDMI, Mini HDMI to HDMI) to get them to work. Where the BARCO is connected via USB so it's powered and only needs one point of contact - the ARIES needs both the display (HDMI) and the USB port (for power) so it is a bit more unwieldy - with the adapters it's almost like a long daisy chain of parts. But the performance was great - it had less jitter and stutter than the BARCO, there was no additional downloading of apps or other software and it connected faster. To be fair the BARCO has other functions - multiple connections etc. - and this is a straight forward one function device. But it does exactly what we needed it to do - we tried it with a Dell Latitude, IPad Pro, MS Surface Pro, and a Dell XPS.Some con's are : it got very very hot after about 45 mins of streaming - hot to the point where you wouldn't want to hold it in your hand, and as expected it has a significant impact on battery consumption. We did have it \"pause\" or go to black screen bc of the connectivity - we're assuming it does not scan for quieter channels for streaming.Overall we would recommend it  as a simple to use streaming device.\n","id":"b5d6bf01-ed23-4c3b-9f3d-7b5d96f81c2a"},{"text":"\n  It’s a great support for the computer\n","id":"e24c1a04-be55-4a5e-82ac-d4b21cb62729"},{"text":"\n   I am an university student.

In my own personal experience, yes the bag bleeds, but there is a simple fix.I am writing this after solving the problem.First, what is causing the bag to bleed on your clothes? The reason the bag is bleeding on your clothes, it's because the leather isn't sealed.The solution: go to the search bar right here on Amazon, copy and paste .... \"Meguiar's G3800 Gold Class Leather Sealer Treatment. \"This should cost you about $12-13.Once you get the leather sealer treatment, it's not rocket science, it literally takes 15 minutes to do the two step process. You literally spray the cleaner on in sections, and wipe it off. Once you're done with the cleaning spray, you go to step 2 which is a sealer (lotion like substance). Same thing, apply in small sections, then buff the sealer with the buffing pad they provided. DoneLet it dry. Repeat the process every 4 to 6 months.Great bag, but for whatever reason Kenneth Cole decided not to seal the leather, for this reason only, I cannot give it 5 stars.Lastly, I provided a picture of before and after, the one on the left is untreated, the one on the right is post treatment. I was still in the midst of buffing all the white stuff off, but you can clearly see the difference.Hope this helps.\n","id":"02cd1a41-e531-4848-a292-bfbfca2ddb97"},{"text":"\n  I bought this bag because of the sleek design, the price, and the claim to full grain leather. Here are my thoughts on the bag,Price: Not expensive but not cheap. Matches the quality of the bag.Leather: The description claims “Full Grain Cowhide leather” for the exterior. This is only partially correct. When you receive the bag, you’ll be greeted with the Genuine leather tag on the side. This was very disappointing as they used the description to trick buyers. The bag does have pieces of full grain leather (which is how they can get away with their claim) but, the majority of the bag is made of low grade genuine leather.Strap: The strap is not thick enough to prevent twisting and the clip is even worse. You’ll constantly have to untwist the strap so that the shoulder pad isn’t upside down. The clip seems oversized for the strap as well. The strap constantly slips and becomes loose.Inside: As you can see from my picture, the back snap caused a hole on the inside of the bag. This is due to cheap/thin material they’ve used.In summary, the bag has served its purpose. It last as longer than I expected for low grade genuine leather. This is by far the best design I’ve come across and I would pay top dollar for a full grain leather bag that looked like this.\n","id":"22ee3215-5e2a-4970-91ba-4afa1795b22a"},{"text":"\n  This is a quality bag for an affordable price.

It’s by far the the best overall built laptop on the market that has power, battery life, portability, and build quality.

Only sometimes. And it wasn't the same blue screen, it would pop up 3 different ones at random sometimes.So I noticed the only thing not update to the newest version was my bios. Thankfully I’ve been building and working with computers for over a decade now and was familiar with doing this. Once done the problem still happened. So I ran out of logical options as I had no clue what to do with this brand new laptop. It worked perfectly after the blue screen went away and it restarted on its own. Like nothing ever happened.But I called asus and they had no idea either then recommended I reformat my brand new laptop I’ve had for 12 days. With regret I had no choice at this point. So I went through the process of wiping the current operating system and redoing everything from scratch. Windows updates, driver updates, installing all the asus apps that work amazing on this specific computer.Finally got it done. Guess what? No more blue screens. So moral of this story is I’m not sure what asus is shipping these laptops with software wise. But I had issues out of the box on mine and ended up having to wipe it all and reformat from scratch. Now for me this isn’t a big deal. But some that are less knowledgeable vs me will struggle massively with this issue. So if some of what I’ve said is confusing or your don’t understand, It’s not a set up and go type of experience I have had. But now it’s problem free and amazing as ever.

It means Shingled Magnetic Recording, basically the data on the drive is written overlapped like shingles on a roof. This means you can get more data on each disk platter, hence less platters for a given size and thus the drive is cheaper. Ok that's great right? Well the problem is this DRASTICALLY slows down the write speed for long sequential writes. It can get bogged down during large writes and become very very slow, like 10MB/s on average slow. Reads are fine it is only writing that is affected.That being said, the SMR technology does make this drive one of the best for $s/TB on the market, just don't expect amazing performance from it.

I can't speak for the long term reliability as I haven't had them for very long, but it has a 1 year warranty (most drives have a 2 or 3 year).

The next thing I did after Windows setup was to check for updates and there were many, including a touch pad firmware update.  After the update, the touch pad  worked and I hope that I now have a functional, powerful, and reliable laptop.  We'll see.  The two star rating is for Lenovo's poor quality control.  And speaking of quality control, several of my colleagues recently purchased high-end Lenovo P1s ($2500 after discounts) and they are all having crashing and freezing issues.  Shame again on Lenovo.  I have several other Lenovo computers, including the one I'm using to write this review, and they work well (except bluetooth failed on this computer).UPDATE:  The GeForce 1650 Ti is supposed to have 4GB of dedicated video memory.  Checking its properties shows only 512MB of dedicated video memory, the same as the internal Radeon graphics driver.  Consequently, full screen video on my 4K external monitor doesn't work, even with 30 Hz rate setting.

I had trouble at first getting the mouse to connect but once I figured out where to go in settings to get the mouse to pair, it paired quickly and is very responsive and does what it’s supposed to do. I also connected this to my Samsung Chromebook and it was quick and worked perfectly as well. For anyone having issues with connecting to iPad follow these simple steps:Go into Settings, then Accessibility, then Touch, then Assistive Touch, turn ON Assistive Touch. Scroll down to and select Pointer Devices. Turn mouse on, click connect on bottom of mouse and when it starts to flash blue you should see Bluetooth Mouse 4.0 appear under Pointer devices and you just select it on the screen of your iPad and it should pair. Once I followed these steps it works perfectly on my iPad Air 3 (2019) running iOS 13.3. You do need to make sure you have upgraded iOS to at least 13.2 version for this mouse to work.\n","id":"f292668b-0c0a-4d16-ad40-fed0be990543"},{"text":"\n  I got this slim and compact Bluetooth mouse to keep in my briefcase when I travel with my laptop.  It was very easy to sync up with Bluetooth (I didn't even have to hold the Connect button down for more than a fraction of a second - not 2 seconds as in the brief manual - and the laptop discovered and linked the mouse).The manual is, to be diplomatic, brief (and with some poor translation).  It does not include any information as to how to know when the mouse is 100% recharged (batteries are sealed and non-removable), so I guess you just charge it up for an hour or two and use it until it fades.  Fortunately, a charging cable is included, so you can plug it into an available USB port and \"mouse-on\" while recharging.Another feature is the DPI selector, which has no indicator and zero explanation in the manual (button is located just below the scroll wheel).  When you push it, you get three different DPI settings, but don't ask which one is the one you're using.  There's no way to know.For an inexpensive mouse, it has a reasonably good feel, quiet left/right buttons, and a matte finish (no fingerprints).  Time will tell if it lasts without falling apart or how long the battery will take recharges.  I will update if things change,\n","id":"97a0f749-a470-4693-8a70-4f96e505a4f3"},{"text":"\n  This does NOT pair with iPadThe ad is wrongSo pissed off right nowNeeded it NOW\n","id":"9a8652c4-d10d-48f5-884c-c362dcd79ea3"},{"text":"\n  I love this mouse. It's sleek, it feels comfortable while using, and it's rechargeable which was important to me since I occasionally travel for work and don't want to be bothered with locating new batteries in a pinch.It's also pretty quiet clicks, as advertised. That was important to me since I host a lot of webinars for work, and don't want to interrupt or distract with a noisy mouse. The turn-wheel however is VERY loud when you click it, which seems a little odd but I'm also not using it often so I'm not concerned.My one complaint is that it can be somewhat unreliable when it comes to its connection. Periodically it just abruptly stops working. When it first happened I assumed it was that the battery was dead, but then I realized it was just not responding. I checked my computer's Bluetooth connections and it still appears as connected (when the battery actually does die it shows as disconnected). If I restart the connection then it often works again. It also oddly will just randomly start working again if I leave it alone for a while. If this could be resolved, I'd highly recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a compact, rechargeable mouse.\n","id":"2e761b6a-9675-42e4-a9ef-41901e67f541"},{"text":"\n  When I bought my laptop I didn't realize it only had 1 USB port.

There are no magic tricks, but you learn the principles of how to get a stronger mindset, how to discover your purpose and beat procrastination, and methods to become limitless such as speed-reading, memory recall, study habits, focus, and decision making.  I think what's most powerful about this book is that you learn the simple art of appreciating yourself. You understand that you are capable of many great things. I certainly have a lot to consider after reading this book. I always thought it was too late in life to learn a new language. But now I don't think so. Now there is so much I want to learn!What I learned:--There are learning myths holding us back.--I love this quote: “Genius leaves clues. There is always a method behind what looks like magic.”  I think you can apply this to so many things in life. If you want to get better at X, look at the masters you admire. What was their story? What did they study?-- Discovering your guiding question will help you make decisions and frame all your actions around a purpose.-- I can read a lot faster and still comprehend! --Rote learning is not the way to remember.

For me, this item does exactly what I need it to do, but some of the features didn't live up to their potential and might be deal breakers for other purchasers.I have a laptop that lives on my bed. I watch movies on it as I'm falling asleep. It's an older cheaper model, so it gets really warm, especially when engulfed in blankets. I needed something that would lift my laptop off the comforter and cool it down. This cooling pad does exactly that.I had read other reviews, so I knew going in that the lights and the fans were not on separate controls. If the fan is on, the light is on. This feature makes me sad, because I didn't realize just how bright the lights would be in a dark bedroom with white walls (see attached image.) Since the lifting off the surface provides enough ventilation for my laptop to not overheat, I don't need the fans on 24/7. I also can fall asleep in a room that isn't pitch black. Be aware - the lights are pretty bright.I have 2 external hard drives with media on them, and my original plan was to plug them into the 2 USB connections on the back of the laptop pad. Imagine my surprise when that didn't work at all. I checked the instructions, and discovered that this item uses a LOT of USB power. When this is plugged into a laptop, you might be able to use a mouse or keyboard with it (although I didn't try either). You definitely CANNOT use an external HD with it. This would have made me very sad, except that I have numerous different USB power sources, so I used a device with a long cord that plugs into the wall and simultaneously charges 4 USB devices to power the cooling fan. It works great, and I don't need to plug anything into the 2 USB connections on the laptop pad. Instead, I plugged my HD's directly into my computer, which is totally capable of powering them when the cooling pad isn't plugged in and stealing all the power.I definitely recommend using external power, which is fairly easy to come by since almost every phone charger has a USB input nowadays. The only downside to that is that the cord isn't very long, so you either need a USB extension cord or a charger with a long cord. Or you need to keep this device really close to an outlet.As for the function of the device, it works great. The fans are powerful enough to keep my laptop nice and cool, and if I run them during the day I can turn them off at night if the blue light is bothering me. Setup was simple, the size is perfect, and the little feet that keep the laptop from sliding off are strong enough to work on my not-so-thin not-so-light laptop. I also like that the height is adjustable, although once I found the angle I liked I didn't change it. My laptop (and my comforter) are no longer hot to the touch, which was a huge issue before purchasing this item.If you don't need the USB connections and you don't care about the light, this item is awesome.

(No plastic parts) The reason I didn’t want to give it five stars was the fact that the adjustable angle was so immovable when we got it, I returned the first one. Then I had a similar problem with this one but was encouraged by an Amazon rep to “put some oil on it”.  I used an aluminum spray. Still it was completely immovable. After several days I pressed hard on it and was finally able to get it to angle. I would not have felt okay doing this if not for the rep encouraging me and saying no matter what they’d take it back.  Well, this finally worked. If this had been mentioned in the description or any prior reviews then I would have felt more comfortable troubleshooting the problem and realizing that this was something that could happen. I am writing this to help others who may have similar experiences. It is lovely. It works great with my laptop for video conferencing and I have a bluetooth Keyboard and mouse so I can type even while this is up on the stand.

Again there are no instructions so I guessed wrong and the stand came apart.Because of this I had to figure out how to stuff the spring back inside and reassemble the lifting support.

The stand is beautiful, sturdy and looks great on my desk.However, after assembling the stand, I placed my HP Envy 17.3t on it just to find that the laptop is taller/higher than the lip on the stand, so the laptop is not stable in place and the lip won't prevent my device from scratching or sliding.To be fair, the bottom of my device is not flat in the front, which caused issues with the lip of the stand.  I could leave the stand flat so that it and my device is not on an angle, but my device is still not securely held or prevented from slipping--even with the rubber pads, so I dare not take the chance, especially if I rotate the stand.  If the lip was higher, this stand/riser would be a perfect fit for my device.HP Envy owners, just be aware that your laptop will not be secure.Sorry Lamicall Stand/Riser, I love you--I just can't use you.\n","id":"902d00c5-df1c-40eb-b2b7-235f70f070dd"},{"text":"\n  This works well on my stand up desk to lift my laptop for ergonomic use.

The concern was that the desk would not be steady when raised to max height. Well after it arrived I set it up (which was very easy out of the box) and placed two 22\" monitors on top along with a wireless keyboard and mouse on the keyboard shelf. I raised it up to accommodate by 6' height standing on a 2\" Topo floor mat and confirmed right away that this desk is solid as a rock. Highly recommended.

Way past the days of the trusty Jansport. I was looking for a nice backpack to cram all of my things in for a full day, as I commute and anything I need for the day, I have to bring it with me.I’ve been using this for a week and I honestly have put away every other bag that I have, including a more tactical-style bag that was my old standby.It fits my MacBook Pro, iPad, chargers for both, notebooks, pens, gum, vitamins, snacks, anything else I need for the day and most importantly to me, a full liter-size water bottle in the side pockets!Can not recommend this backpack any more than I do, absolutely fully satisfied and will definitely be returning for more Polare products.\n","id":"a2fdb306-3166-4ba8-b0e1-3cbadc3539bb"},{"text":"\n  I've only had it for about a week now, but I've used it pretty much every day since it arrived. I had originally ordered another brand which I really liked style-wise, but it turned out to be too small for what I needed to carry so I bought this as my second choice.What I like:The styling is nice. It's a little darker than I thought, but still good looking. It's leather, so of course it has that wonderful look and feel.The leather appears to be of good quality, and the stitching looks good. I like the top handle. Once it gets broken in I think it will be quite comfortable.It fits my Lenovo P50 with ease and still has quite a bit of interior room.The zippers operate smoothly and appear to be of decent quality.Straps:Even though they have redesigned the straps and added rivets, I'm still concerned about their long term durability. I carry quite a bit of weight (if you have a P50 you'll know what I mean) and spend much of the time with the pack slung over just one shoulder. That puts the full stress on one strap in kind of a sideways pull. While the straps appear to be pretty solidly attached, they also appear to be made of the same thickness of leather as the pack itself. There is padding which adds some strength, but I still think I would have liked seeing a thicker leather and maybe more reinforcement used in a place that takes so much stress. So far it's holding up fine, but we'll see what it looks like a year from now.Pockets:There are 5 pockets on the back. This is both good and bad. On one hand, it gives a lot of ways to organize, but on the other hand, each pocket is quite small. The reason the photo shows all those things sticking out is because most of them wouldn't actually fit in the pockets they are shown in with the flap closed.I would much rather have seen two larger pockets instead of the 4 lower ones, at least one of which was big enough to hold the big brick power supply of the P50. Or even just replacing the two bottom pockets with one big one would have been welcome. But since none of the pockets are even remotely big enough for the power supply I have to put it inside where it takes up a lot of valuable space and is always in the way.I'm undecided on the strap/flap closures on 3 of the pockets. They work ok now, but it's really Velcro that holds the flap closed and the strap is a bit more form than function. As long as the Velcro doesn't wear out, they'll probably continue to work ok. Wish they had come up with something more \"traditional\" than Velcro though.The \"pencil\" pocket could have been a little bigger (deeper) too. It would be a great place to keep reading glasses and/or sunglasses, except that it can only really hold one pair comfortably, and depending on the style, even one might be a bit tight. I have both reading and sunglasses, and I can barely squeeze two pair of small reading glasses or the sunglasses, but I can't put sunglasses and even one pair of reading glasses in at the same time without crushing them.The water bottle pockets seem ample for a normal sized water bottle. I rarely carry a water bottle with me, but do occasionally throw a couple sodas in there to restock my desk. They of course fit easily. You could probably put an umbrella in one too, but I don’t like my umbrella on display all the time so I prefer to keep it inside.Back:The back is both good and bad as well. The breathable fabric is probably nice if you are wearing it around all day, but I use it just for commuting and think a full leather back would probably have better long term durability. Plus I think the fabric back somewhat detracts from the \"rustic\" look. As near as I can tell, there is no leather in the back at all other than the reinforcing band for the straps (it doesn’t feel thick enough to have a layer of leather sandwiched in there) and a solid leather back would have made a much more solid attachment for straps too.Interior:The interior is pretty good. There is a big divider with a Velcro strap which holds the laptop nicely, although the strap is of limited use and tends to get in the way as much as keeping anything secure (like all straps in laptop bags).Might have been nice to have one more large divider in there to keep papers and folders separate from the laptop. As is I end up putting them together and it gets a little tricky to slide things in sometimes.There is a zippered pocket which is much larger than any of the outside pockets, so it ends up as a catch-all for all the things I couldn't fit in the outside. The drawback is it's not made of leather, but rather the lighter weight lining material, so I don't know how well it will hold up in the long term with everything crammed in to it.Another pen holder or two would be welcome. There are only two. I also would probably prefer to have them with \"bottoms\" so the pens would stay in without having to clip them to the pocket. They are made out of the same leather as the pack, but for this application that leather is actually a little too thick. I broke the clip off one of my pens trying to get it to expand enough to accommodate the thickness of the leather. Since they are just loops without bottoms, if you don't clip the pen to the leather it just falls through the hole and gets lost in the bottom. So I'm either breaking pens or losing them.It may sound like I'm nitpicking, and I am. But don't get me wrong - it's a really nice pack. I have high hopes for it and I can't wait to see how it looks and feels a year or two from now once it's broken in. (assuming it holds up)Just a few things that I wish had been thought through a little better on a pack that costs nearly a hundred and sixty dollars. Maybe the next redesign will incorporate a few of my suggestions…Until then, I’m going to continue using it and hope I don’t have to make use of the 1 year warranty.Update 12/31/19: Three months later it's still going strong. The straps are holding up well and aren't showing any signs of tearing yet. The handle has softened up nicely. Zippers still work smoothly. No signs of torn stitching or fabric yet. Still happy!\n","id":"4b2b85dd-3f18-48a9-87c2-a58507dbc1a7"},{"text":"\n  I love my my new leather backpack.

This review is based on my needs and everyone has different uses for a backpack but from my perspective this is the best pack I've ever had, for the money of course. There are a lot of very nice packs on the market for $300 to $500 dollars so don't expect to get a free lunch.  some people complained about the straps coming off and the company added rivets which is very rare for a company so points for them. If you are carrying heavy weight for miles and miles of rough trial this isn't the pack for you but for work and school it's perfect. Things I like about it:It stands up on it is own.  Most packs fall over and I find this very convenient.It looks fantastic and is made of very nice leather, full grain but still pliable.The zippers move like butter, no sticking, and made of metal, not plastic.The pockets are perfect size and help organize things so that I don't have to go digging for my keys, wallet, change, aspirin, phone charger...It is light and comfortable, even loaded down I can throw one strap over my shoulder and it doesn't try to slip off.The padded vented back is very comfy. Some people complained that it isn't as sturdy as the old leather back model but if you are ripping this back you're doing something wrong.  It's plenty strong and much more comfortable.It's perfect size, I don't like huge bags, especially while traveling, it's a fantastic carry-on.It smells awesome and, if you're a fashionista, goes well with everything but a tuxedo.Cons:  the padding for the laptop pocket could be thicker but I don't carry my laptop so not a concern.The Velcro patches on the pockets could be larger/ stronger. But the straps add to security so, again, I don't think its an issue as long as you close the straps.I don't need two water bottle pockets and would have liked another zipper pocket instead of two bottle holders.I'm not part of this company, I've just been ripped off and disappointed with products so often I was shocked to get a quality pack and I'm giving credit where it's due. I've looked all over the web and you won't find a better bag in this price range.\n","id":"eefa8277-7116-45a5-91ab-2dcb03165052"},{"text":"\n  Excellent\n","id":"594751ac-51df-49e1-aa6d-a8a1064f2f4a"},{"text":"\n  Works as described.

I hesitated for a while at first as I had seen many negative reviews regarding gigabyte laptops but after having used this laptop for a while now, I can safely say it might just be the best laptop I've had in a while.Build quality: The build quality on this laptop is fantastic, all aluminum so it feels really premium. It also has a really nice design in my opinion. Really muted which I happen to like. My only concern is the hinge. The hinge just doesn't seem tight enough? It causes the display to shake sometimes but never when i'm typing so that's good. It's also a one hand open. Laptop is pretty light as well but the power brick, being 230watts is pretty big.Display: Wow, the display is really great here. The 4K OLED panel is really bright and really vibrant. It doesn't get past 500nits but it was a sacrifice gigabyte had to make to get good deltaE values. Contrast is amazing, color gamut is really good on here. Only down side is that it's 60hz. Hope to see high refresh oled screens on laptops sometime soon. I can see banding sometimes but I rarely notice it.Performance: The 1660ti along with the i7-9750h is a pretty good spot for me. Getting gaming out of the way, I usually get around 120fps in Apex Legends, 100FPS in Resident Evil 2, 150fps in Overwatch &  90FPS in Soul Calibur. All games were in high settings, with the exception of overwatch being at epic settings and all games were ran at 1080p. I can't push many games at 4k. In terms of Video Editing and Rendering in Unity & Blender, the 1660ti also has studio drivers on the AERO and render times have been pretty good as well as editing video has been pretty smooth, though I don't do video editing often.Thermals: Thermals on my unit weren't great... but they weren't all that bad. I've never experienced any thermal throttling. GPU temps are usually around 75c-84c under load and CPU temps are higher at around 90-92c. You can drop the temps by about 3-5c by enabling max fans, but they do get REALLY loud at that point.Keyboard & Trackpad: I love the keyboard on the AERO. The backlighting is plenty customizable and bright. The keys have a pretty nice travel distance so it feels pretty good to type on. The trackpad is glass so it's really smooth, and it has windows precision drivers so gestures and such work like a breeze. It also has a fingerprint scanner, which is quite fast and works fine for me.Software: The laptop comes with no bloatware except for GIGABYTE Fusion & the AI software, which I guess aren't bloatware because they're pretty useful for controlling fans, keyboard lighting, etc.. Almost all my drivers were out of date but hey, control center makes it super easy to update drivers and in about 30m, all my drivers were updated. I personally like and have no problems with control center but the AI software still seems gimmicky.Fan noise: Fans do get super loud under load but otherwise, I hardly hear them. As states above, max fans do sound like a jet engine. You also have full customization over the fans using gigabyte fusion.Battery Life: Battery life for me while typing docs, browsing the web, 40% brightness and keyboard backlight on was about 4-5 hours for me. Haven't tested it while gaming though.Camera: The camera is the worst part about this laptop for me. Bad quality, bad position. Rarely use it though so I don't care much. They have a privacy cover for it though so for people concerned about privacy, no tape required.I'll continue to update this review as the months go along using the AERO, but so far, really happy customer.Some other things:-Laptop has a second m2 slot for SATA&NVME SSDs, gigabyte also includes extra thermal pads for any secondary ssd you might add. The Stock SSD is really fast too.As of November 17, 2020, I populated my second m2 slot with a Sabrent Rocket 1tb nvme SSD, and have no issues with it on the laptop. Speeds are really fast too at around 2000mb/s r/3000mb/s w.-I've seen alot of complaints with the wifi card on the AERO, but wifi experience on my model has been excellent. No problems w/ download & upload speeds over WiFi on my model and no drop outs.***Update***It's been one month w/ the Aero 15 now, no issues so far. Still love this laptop.**11/17/2020 Update*My GPU fan started making a loud grinding noise after about 3 months of owning the laptop. I'm not sure what caused this, but my guess is that the bearing went out. A couple months following this, the fan completely gave out and stopped spinning completely. I decided to get a replacement fan myself on AliExpress and replace the fan. Replacing the fan was pretty easy and while I was at it, I also re-pasted my CPU and GPU with Artic MX-4 thermal paste. Following the replacement and re-paste, my fans are much quieter now and thermals are much better than they were before. I'm able to maintain 3.8ghz on all cores during full CPU load. I'm still dropping my rating by 2 stars as I am disappointed that the fan gave out in such a short time. Looking at reddit for the experience that other people had with this laptop, it seems to be a pretty big issue with this model. I'm not sure if this holds true for the 2020 model, but I can only hope it's fixed. Other than this, I have had no more issues with this laptop and everything has still been fine, especially performance now following the re-paste. The fan model for anyone curious is: PLB0701S12HH. My opinion still stands, I still think this is a great laptop, but I hope gigabyte does fix the issue with the fans. If you look on reddit, people have guides on how to fix the fans without buying a replacement.\n","id":"6661212b-c274-4494-bd3e-c45b4f06f2a1"},{"text":"\n  I've owned this device over a month and here's my opinion:** For the look, for me, it's very good, as I need to use the device for business, so it does not look like other gaming machines with red colors and logos that make your device out of place if you're in a meeting or so.** For the build quality, it's my first high-end laptop I've used, since for me I think it's also very good.** The screen is impressive for me, and I can tell that's the best screen I've ever used.==> PERFORMANCE:Let's split this into two parts:** Windows:- The first time I'm logged into Windows, it was bulky and full of garbage and has a bad performance, then after doing a clean install it now works like charm.** Linux:Since I use Linux for work and it's the main OS I'm using on the PC and the laptop for my work, after I've installed Linux all the problems started:- The heating issue that the device reaches 80 C easily and the fans still run slow because you can't control the fans from Linux.- You also can't control Fans from BIOS even it's UEFI, so still no solution for this issue.- Contacted Gigabyte and this is another big problem to contact Gigabyte and hardly after a month I could reach them then they replied we don't support Linux and The solution they have is to work on Windows!!!- Now I can't return the device as they responded very late, and also I get this device in order to work on it mainly and besides work, I play some games, But they want me to only play games!!!==> Conclusion============- If you need a device with good customer support--> STAY AWAY FROM GIGABYTE.- If you plan to use Linux mainly on this device --> STAY AWAY FROM GIGABYTE.- If you don't care about support or Linux and need a good device in terms of built quality, perfect screen and will use windows as your main OS then you may try (I'm not responsible for this advice).==> For me, it's the FIRST and LAST laptop and the LAST product I'll use from GIGABYTE as their support is the worst support I've ever dealt with, hence support and after-sales service is essential for me.\n","id":"7e12218a-9fcf-4360-8a11-3196485ee50f"},{"text":"\n  Pros-Oled display is gorgeous with absolutely no defects.1660Ti runs all my games externally at 1440p flawlessly (Witcher 3 with \"Hairworks\" off and Sekiro stable at 60fps on Ultra)1660Ti is compatible with Nvidia Studio, so my engineering software renders models as if using professional GPU5+ hours of realistic battery life on a gaming laptop with 4k displayBuild Quality is excellent.

The instructions are a bit vague, I had to look under the question/answer section here to find some helpful info.I was skeptical and nervous purchasing this but Im glad I did. I do wish the remote was a a bit smaller, it can be bulky carrying and controlling a dog at the same time. I have 70lb bully rescue and this collar has been helping me control and train her along with positive reinforcement. Before she would lunge with full force at other dogs, humans and bikers. I am a short female so it doesn’t take much for her to knock me down (trust me).This collar does make her think twice. I like the 3 functions. The vibrations does nothing for her lol, she’ll completley ignore it. The beep beep noise gets her attention when there’s no dogs around and I need her to walk next to me and not all over the place.  Now the shocking part. I do love the rubber covers that go over the prongs. It’s not metal to skin which gives me a sense of relief. I did test out each shock level on my hand. I thought it would be only right to experience what pain she might be inflicted on. When I turned it on and figured it out, I accidentally shocked myself on 99. That’s the level it is set on when I received it. I was not prepared for it. Through the searching part I mentioned earlier I figured out how to control the levels. So after feeling 99 I wasn’t as scared as much, sense I got it out of the way But I did feel it all the way to my knee caps lol.I’ve had to use the shock on her, it is a learning experience and you need to find a comfortable “medium”. For her 25 made her yelp and freak out and 22 really gets her to focus on me without the yelp. Under 22 the shock feeling is just a tingle.I was really against shock collars at first but since I rescued her I needed to be a responsible bully owner. I don’t like the lunging or barking and she does come off scary and I don’t want people to be afraid of her because she is really sweet. I did have to do my own research with books and videos on how to use the collar properly. She is not afraid of it, when I grab the collar she gets excited because that means we’re going for a walk. The charge does last a long time. Almost a month, mostly because I only have it on her when we go for walks. Again I do use this with positive reinforcement.Despite some of the struggles I went through at the beginning it gets 5 stars because it does the job. I also love the lock on the side. It prevents any accidental pushing of the buttons.\n","id":"c3b7bb1c-d120-4a72-9017-4413188fa0c7"},{"text":"\n  This remote training collar is amazing!!

The beeping noise did nothing to stop her.  She doesn't like the vibration, but that doesn't always stop her behavior.  The shock though works!  I tested it on myself first and it feels like you touched an electric fence.  No pain, just an uncomfortable strange sensation.  I have only used it on a low setting for the shock, but it definitely gets her attention and she follows commands immediately.  I used this collar for about 2 weeks off and on and every since then she's mellowed out.  If she does start to act up I just need to show her the collar (not even put it on her) and she corrects her behavior.  I have 2 other friends who have used this same collar with great success too.  I was training my dog not to jump on people, bark and to stop biting/mouthing people.  This worked great to stop all 3 behaviors.\n","id":"37320a98-d408-4686-9068-aa11b5e95aa0"},{"text":"\n  I ordered this set in anticipation of upgrading my laptop.

One of my laptops is very large (a mobile workstation with a 17.3\" display) laptop and a smaller 13\" laptop.Advertised material and dimensions are NOT accurate:==========================================The product was advertised with the following dimensions:SPECS:(1) Outside Dimensions: 19x11x2 in(2) Panel Size: 16x11in(3) Width Between Legs: 18.3 in(4) Height Range: Adjustable from 2-18 in(5) Panel Rotation: 360-degrees, locks every 15-degrees(6) Product Weight: 3.3 lbs(7) Material: AluminumThe ACTUAL between the leg width is 17.25\" at the widest (middle) joint and 15.75\" at the narrowest (first) joint. My large laptop is 16.68\" wide, so the middle joint overlaps the bevel a little.The product is advertise as 'aluminum' but the legs are PLASTIC and could potentially snap if you weren't careful with it.Poorly packaged:=============The product shipped in the box it came in and was not sealed, so I have no idea if this is a new product or something that was returned.Overall impression:===============I think if you buy this product for use in a stationary environment (e.g. to set it on top of a desk where it never moves and isn't holding anything too heavy), it'll probably work fine. If you intend to pick it up and move it around frequently, the plastic legs will likely snap off at some point.\n","id":"de11cb91-dd0b-44e2-a460-2db93cca50de"},{"text":"\n  The leg-locking mechanisms are great, and the design is pretty ingenious. The problem I have with it is that it's quite lightweight, and I wanted to use it as a way of raising my desktop keyboard so I can work at my desk while standing. I tend to lean too heavily on the keyboard when standing, so while it's never collapsed or tipped over, it isn't super-steady, so I have to work to not lean on it. Also, there is a mouse tray that can be attached to it. It works okay (you have to use a rollerball mouse, or adjust your mouse settings, because the tray is small), but the mouse tray has the same issue. In my work, I often have to keep on hand on the mouse at all times, so of course, I put too much weight on it, that tends to make the mouse tray sag a bit. Once my busy season is over, I will try it again--maybe work on my posture! It would probably work great with a laptop and no mouse, or for someone who is better at holding their hands off the keyboard, or a smaller person (I'm 6'2\", 195).\n","id":"f578e70a-54da-4895-8a46-d4b88644f9cc"},{"text":"\n  Works good, very adjustable, light weight for moving between bedroom to LR.

This has disappointed many fans (to some extent, myself included) who revel in the energy of his earlier works.In some ways, \"If the Stars are Eternal ...\" harks back to his first album, Ima, which was a bit slower and more laid back than later works. It also has some similarities to \"This Binary Universe\".Overall, this is a more up-beat and (in places) up-tempo work than This Binary Universe and hangs together a bit better. It's more trancey than jazzy. So if you don't mind a laid-back ambient album in BT's style then you should be quite happy with it.Essentially, BT has managed to strike a good balance between his desire to produce something ambient with just enough faster bits to keep listeners interested.

I am happy to say that the MacBook Pro fits perfectly, and it is not a tight fit by any means. The pouch also fits the charger and a few dongles with ease, and it certainly does not feel stuffed. The quality of this case surprised me considering the price tag. The handle is a nice feature and the padding is adequate.I did a lot of research for a case that would comfortably fit the new MacBook Pro since these models are considerably smaller than previous models with the same size screen. I was led to this case as the best all around and I am very happy with my purchase. I have not had it long yet so can't comment on the durability but overall it feels very high quality and I am confident that it will not let me down.\n","id":"757e798d-7728-408a-ac4a-7128c296d2d8"},{"text":"\n  I bought the \"13 - 13.5 inch\" model for my Macbook Pro 15\" (2016 w/Touchbar) and it's a perfect fit - I was looking for a sleeve that had a tight fit, and this is the closest I've gotten. And no, it's not a typo: I really got the 13-13.5\" sleeve!The MacBook pro does not move in the sleeve, yet the sides of the laptop stay loose enough from the zipper since there is a little bumper that separates laptop and zipper. I have tried a few other ones (like the Amazon Basics), but all of them are either way too big, or simply too small, or just a too tight for my taste (where the zipper gets way too close to the corners of the laptop).The side pocket is the right size for charger and a few USB-C adapters (thanks Apple for making things \"compact\"). I suspect that even an iPad will fit in there.Inside padding is very soft and feel very nice, like it will minimize scratches. The sides of the sleeve feel sturdy like they will protect the MacBook Pro against bumps. Handle feels nice and solid. All in all this sleeve feels much smaller than expected, and works very well as a day-to-day sleeve, and for when you're traveling and would like to stow your laptop in your carry-on.Only way to improve on this one if I'd be able to attach a shoulder strap, but then again, I probably wouldn't use it anyway hahah.All in all: I highly recommend this 13-13.5\" sleeve for MacBook Pro 15\" 2016 w/Touchbar owners.\n","id":"e1a0814e-6842-4a85-9a10-84ba6a6d17f8"},{"text":"\n  My 15\" MacBook Pro fits well in this case, without forcing and without too much extra room.

It fits my charger, external hard drive and a CF card adapter, without forcing and without adding too much bulk.The 2 zippers on this case open all the way around to the handle, making access to my laptop super easy. But, that feature is sort of the only thing I'd change on this bag, if I could lol. The handle is on the opposite side of the full zipper opening and the first day I had the case, I didn't realize I had the zipper opened on the other side, picked up the case by the handle, which resulted in my laptop falling out the other side, onto the floor. It's not a deal breaker and was my own stupidity, but it's definitely something I need to think about, each time I take my laptop in and out of it.I also got a Kuzy laptop cover, in hot blue and it matches the teal color on this case pretty well.Bottom line, this is a great laptop case and I DID NOT receive any discounts for this review.\n","id":"6a2d159e-70d1-43da-a8c3-76cb54786237"},{"text":"\n  Absolutely tremendous.

With this drive, I found negative review after negative review where the buyers' primary complaint seemed to have something to do with them believing they received the WRONG product!First off, the models \"ST500LX025\" (500GB), \"ST1000LX015\" (1TB), and \"ST2000LX001\" (2TB) are the model numbers for the NEWEST version of the drives. Amazon isn't shipping out the \"old\" version.  The \"Z\" part of the model number seen on the packaging has to do with the fact that these drives now come in a basic brown box, instead of the colorful retail packaging.Also, the FireCuda line is now called \"Compute\" (see Seagate's website and product manuals to confirm), so receiving a drive that doesn't say \"Gaming\" does not mean you got the \"wrong drive\", it means you got a more recently-manufactured drive with an updated label.None of those reviewers even bothered looking up model numbers or drive information to see if they actually got the \"wrong\" product.  In fact, as of writing this, the \"Top Review\" for this drive is a 1-star review from someone that doesn't know how to turn off their OS's drive spin-down and also incorrectly claimed they received an old model. The product they received was fine, and the review actually highlighted their own, personal flaws, yet their 1-star review now says \"55 people found this helpful\" under it. Really? THAT review helped people?For an actual product review, so far it seems like a standard 5400 RPM drive. Yes, it is 5400 RPM, and it also uses Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR). SMR drives have reduced write speeds compared to standard Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (PMR) drives, but read speeds are pretty similar. That's one reason why this drive was marketed as a \"gaming\" drive. You install a game once, but read from it many times. Read speed is the important part, and so with that SMR should work just fine. This drive is not recommended if you write tons of data and need the fastest speeds. For that, a 7200 PMR drive or SSD would be recommended.The limited benchmarking I've done make the drive look like a typical hard drive. I get around 140MB/sec speeds from the outside of the platters, and only around 60MB/sec on the inside of the platters. Programs like CrystalDiskMark may give a good idea of what kinda of speeds to expect from an SSD (where read/write speeds are consistent on all available storage), but can give quite misleading results on a hard drive (where speeds are a LOT slower near the inside of the platters or when data is highly fragmented).In most scenarios, this will operate as a standard 2TB 5400 RPM drive. However, some frequently-accessed data will be saved in the 8GB NAND cache, allowing for much faster loads. This only works with data that is repeatedly accessed. Playing one game over and over yields the best results. The first load with be normal speeds, but each load after that should be quicker and quicker, eventually getting near-SSD speeds. However, if you frequently rotate games, playing different ones every day, you may not notice the speedier loading as much, as the cache will less likely to have the data you're trying to access.It's unfortunate that most of the submitted photos for this product are screenshots from CrystalDiskMark (which give no indication of read/write speeds for the entire drive) or pictures of the actual product received (from buyers that think they got the \"wrong\" drive).For a great, in-depth review of the drive's performance (with multiple benchmarks), do a Google search for the eTeknix' review of the ST2000LX001.I didn't give the product 5-stars for a few reasons. One, I figured my review might get lost in all the other 5-star reviews.Two, I felt there were compromises in the drive's design. Even if the drive performs GREAT as-is, how much better do you think the performance COULD HAVE been if it was a 7200 RPM drive? Or if it used regular magnetic storage instead of the slower \"shingled\" magnetic storage? Or if the NAND cache was 16 or 32GB instead of 8GB? Or if the RAM cache was 256MB instead of 128MB? Sure, the drive might cost a bit more, but it would still be way cheaper than an SSD with the same amount of storage space.\n","id":"191de06e-81a3-49b7-a923-4f0a35ff272f"},{"text":"\n  I was led to a screen saying there was a newer model.

If you go between folders with lots of pictures, it is so slow it will say it's not responding for a few seconds, then it will slowly start loading.My computer is an MSI, with the OS running off an SSD, and my computer is fast and well maintained.

I went with the 10' length and that's fine for my needs.I couldn't justify $300 for pure copper cable for my limited usage so this cable was a surprise at this price!I would recommend it highly\n","id":"29e8d0b9-fdfd-4d9f-9035-5013a9fd0770"},{"text":"\n  Lots of 1-stars reporting the same issue I had... this is a balanced cable and will not work with an iPad/iPod/iPhone when connected to a mixing console.

I also use this for listening to guitar that I play through Neural DSP on my computer. Great value!\n","id":"e0ab1446-2d15-4bd9-a54b-9fd3604efade"},{"text":"\n  I work as a performing artist. I use 1/4\" to headphone jack cables to connect my laptop to my soundboard for shows, playing backing tracks through the laptop into the board. I've found that these size cables tend to die quickly, perhaps because they're thin. I always keep extras with my gear for this reason. When my last one went I replaced it with this one, based on the good reviews here on Amazon. My sound tech and I noticed the difference in audio quality between this and \"regular\" 1/4\" to 3.5mm cables immediately. You can tell when holding this cable that it's sturdier and a better quality than others I've used. It produces vastly better audio and I will be purchasing another one.\n","id":"1ccacc20-9f96-4285-93ae-562f86a14aa9"},{"text":"\n  Seeing a few other reviews, I was somewhat expecting  some gremlin to show up and I was elated to sail through the install process just as they said it would be.

At first, I thought the version with the screen touchpad was older, but then I saw that the ASUS website had both kinds.I have to say the screenpad is BETTER than I thought. It easily switches from touchpad to screenpad and back. It's very easy to use and better as a touchpad than any I have used before. I do not see much need to carry a mouse now, and that will decrease the bulk. Also, the charge cord and wall wart are small, but the length is good.This looks and feels like a high quality laptop. No question about it. I got the Moss Green version... it's only that color in some lighting. In other lighting it's more of a bronze color, but both colors are awesome. The screen is nice, and I don't miss my old 17\" laptop that's 6 years old.ASUS bloatware was almost non-existant. I did upgrade to win 10 pro as I needed that functionality.I noticed a disconnect while using the 5g channel on a router... we will see if that's an issue going forward.The only real con I see is the lack of a detachable battery.\n","id":"f26d61a5-781e-4b0c-9fa3-249741eaf73d"},{"text":"\n  I am so impressed with how great this computer is....all my other laptops are windows 7, besides my all in one, this is my 1st windows 10 laptop....it opens up in 30 seconds and shuts down the same!!!

I looked at it for a while, and finally broke down and purchased it. The size and weight was perfect but, when I finally received it and started to use it  I found out that it was not user friendly as they made it out to be. If you use the duel mouse pad just as a mouse pad will decrease the battery life very rapidly. I was charging the the laptop at least two to three times a day. If you use it with the icons then the battery life will last you a lot longer. You would think it would be the other way around.
